This association will be done in two different methods, with the "<i>Import</i>" function by importing the list of devices and adding the room information, or through auto discovery by selecting the specific room from list of available rooms.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>In the <i>Report </i>tab, admins can finally see the BYOD rooms specific utilization metrics. However, an 8$ Teams Shared Device license will need to be assigned per room to have access to the BYOD usage report.</p><p><img src="https://img-prod-cms-rt-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/cms/api/am/imageFileData/RW1cUwu?ver=1b5b" style="width: 400px;">&nbsp;</p>
