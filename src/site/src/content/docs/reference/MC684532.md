<p>With the forward message feature, Microsoft Teams users will soon be able to send chat messages from one chat to another. Messages can be forwarded to 1:1 chats, group chats and meeting chats. This feature will also allow the sender to add additional content to the message in order to provide context and clarity to the recipient.  This feature will be rolling out across Microsoft Teams Desktop, Web and Mobile.</p><p>This message is associated with Microsoft 365 Roadmap ID <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?filters=&amp;searchterms=90585" target="_blank">90585</a></p><p>[When this will happen:]</p><p>Rollout will begin in late November 2023 and is expected to be complete by mid-February 2024.</p><ul><li>Targeted release: Rollout will occur in late November 2023</li><li>Standard release: Rollout will occur in mid-January 2024</li><li>GCC, GCCH and DoD: Rollout will begin in late January 2024 and be complete by mid-February 2024</li></ul><p>How this will affect your organization:]</p><p>The entry point for the forward message feature will be in the overflow menu.&nbsp;<br></p><p><img src="https://img-prod-cms-rt-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/cms/api/am/imageFileData/RW1dchm?ver=4fb5" style="width: 300px;"><img src="https://img-prod-cms-rt-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/cms/api/am/imageFileData/RW1d4AY?ver=0d67" style="width: 120px;"><br></p><p>Upon clicking this button, the forward message compose dialog will populate the screen.&nbsp;<br></p><p><img src="https://img-prod-cms-rt-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/cms/api/am/imageFileData/RW1dchn?ver=dbea" style="width: 300px;"><img src="https://img-prod-cms-rt-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/cms/api/am/imageFileData/RW1d73V?ver=854c" style="width: 120px;"><br></p><p>In the compose dialog, users will have the option to select from the people picker menu who the message will be forwarded to.
