Thank you for your patience.</span></p><p style="font-size: larger;"><i style="font-size: 14px;">This applies to customers with Exchange Online Protection, Microsoft Defender for Office plan 1 or plan 2 service plans.</i><br></p><p>Soon, admins can provide intent when <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/security/office-365-security/submissions-admin?" target="_blank">submitting </a>messages (email and Microsoft Teams), email attachments, or URLs to Microsoft. 
</p><p>Admins can convey whether they are submitting for a second opinion from Microsoft or they are submitting because a true malicious message was missed by Microsoft. With this change, Microsoft analysis of admin submitted messages (email and Microsoft Teams), URLs, and email attachments will be further streamlined and will result in more accurate analysis.</p><p><br></p>
