<p>Updated September 12, 2023: We have updated the content below with additional information.</p><p>SharePoint and OneDrive conditional access policies for unmanaged devices will start to be enforced for Office Scripts files. This means that users on unmanaged devices will have their access to Office Scripts functionality restricted based on policies you have enabled in your tenant.<br></p><p><b>When this will happen:</b><br></p><p>We will be turning enforcement on in late September and start rolling out an updated error message for Excel clients. The rollout of the error message will complete based on the deployment schedule for each update channel.</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b>
</p><p>Users on unmanaged devices may start encountering errors if they attempt to use Office Scripts in Excel or Power Automate.  In older versions of Excel, they may see the generic error: "We can't find this script. It may have been deleted by another user." 
</p><p><img src="https://img-prod-cms-rt-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/cms/api/am/imageFileData/RW1byOx?ver=2b83" style="width: 400px;"></p><p>Eventually, this error message will be updated to: "Due to organizational policies, you can't access this script from this untrusted device."</p><p><img src="https://img-prod-cms-rt-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/cms/api/am/imageFileData/RW1brar?ver=3248" style="width: 400px;"></p><p>Additionally, because Office Script files will be treated like text files, users on unmanaged devices may not able to access Office Scripts from the browser even under a policy that allows web-only access.</p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b><br></p><p>If there are users in your tenant who are currently using Office Scripts on an unmanaged device, let them know that their access to Office Scripts may be disrupted and they should switch to a managed device to avoid disruption.</p>
