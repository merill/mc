<p style="">Today we’re starting to roll out the <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-teams-blog/introducing-the-new-microsoft-teams-now-in-preview/ba-p/3774406" target="_blank">preview of the new Microsoft Teams desktop app for Windows</a>. The new <a href="https://aka.ms/NewTeams" target="_blank">Microsoft Teams desktop app</a> is built on a foundation of speed, performance, and flexibility—saving you time and helping your organization work together more efficiently.  
</p><p style=""><b>How will this benefit my organization:</b></p><p style="">Our goal for the new Teams app is to make it twice as fast while using half the system resources. We aren’t done optimizing the performance of new Teams, but we are already seeing common scenarios such as app load and meeting join hit that goal, as well as a 50% reduction in memory.  We have also observed significant gains in installation time, disk space used, chat and channel switch time, search, and more.
</p><p style="">The new Teams app also adds support for organizations that have multiple tenants and users who must manage multiple accounts. Users can be signed into multiple tenants and accounts simultaneously and receive notifications no matter which one is currently in use.
</p><p style=""><b>Note:</b> Not all customer segments (Education, Special Cloud, GCC, GCC-High and DoD) and platforms (Mac, VDI, and Web) will receive this update at this time. While the new Teams preview includes much of the same functionality as classic Teams, there are a few features which are not yet available. Visit this <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/new-teams-desktop-admin" target="_blank">page</a> to learn more about what’s currently available and what’s coming up.
</p><p style=""><b>How will I preview the new Teams experience:</b></p><ul><li>If you are in the&nbsp;<a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/public-preview-doc-updates" target="_blank">public preview program</a>, you will have access to the <i>Try the new Teams toggle</i>.

Please refer to MC post MC510331 for Targeted release rollout timelines. Prior to this announcement, the Targeted release provided early access to OneDrive for Business, SharePoint Online, Office for the web, Microsoft 365 admin center, and some components of Exchange Online. Admins and select users in the Targeted release program can be among the first to see the latest Teams innovations. 
</li><p></p><p><b>Note:</b> Admins can choose individuals or the entire organization to receive updates in the Targeted release program.
</p><li>If you are in production, as an admin you will have the option to opt-in your users by using the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/new-teams-desktop-admin#how-to-roll-out-new-teams" target="_blank">Teams update management policy</a> to select which users in your organization can see the toggle and get access to new Teams.
