<p>The Outlook for Android Settings page is being updated so that you can find the settings you need more efficiently.</p><p>This message is associated with Microsoft 365 Roadmap ID <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?filters=&amp;searchterms=185387" target="_blank">185387</a></p><p><b>When this will happen:</b></p><p>Standard Release: We will begin rolling out in mid-February 2024 and expect to complete by the end of February 2024.</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b></p><p>With this update, only the placement of various settings within the Settings page will change. However, there will be no changes to the functionality of these settings.</p><p>Notable changes include:</span></p><ul><li>Help &amp; Feedback is moving from the top of the Settings page to the bottom.
</li><li>You will now have to select Accounts on the top-level Settings page to see all of your accounts. In that account list, storage accounts have been merged with their associated mail account. So, if you have both your Microsoft 365 email account and your OneDrive account connected to the Outlook app, you will now just see one entry in the account list that includes both the email and storage account settings.</li></ul><p><img src="https://img-prod-cms-rt-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/cms/api/am/imageFileData/RW1gyvK?ver=8c06" style="width: 200px;"><br></p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b></p><p>There is no action needed to prepare for this change.
