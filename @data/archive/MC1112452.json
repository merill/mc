This feature aligns with existing functionality in Outlook for desktop and web, bringing a consistent experience across platforms. When a message is from a sender we couldn’t verify as safe, users will see a banner in the reading pane warning them to be cautious.</p><p>This message is associated with Microsoft 365 Roadmap ID <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?filters=&amp;searchterms=491471\" target=\"_blank\">491471</a>.</p><p><b>When this will happen:</b></p><p>General Availability (Worldwide): We will begin rolling out mid-July 2025 and expect to complete by mid-August 2025.</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b>\n</p><p>When users receive an email from an unverified sender, they will see a banner in the reading pane explaining why the sender is flagged and warning about potential impersonation. This complements existing safety messages such as:\n</p><ul><li>“External sender”\n</li><li>“Not on safe senders list”\n</li><li>“You don’t often get email from this sender”\n</li></ul><p>This feature is available by default when the unverified signal is received by the service. There are no admin controls to configure or disable this functionality.</p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b>\n</p><p>No admin action is required. However, we recommend informing your users about this new visual cue and its purpose.
