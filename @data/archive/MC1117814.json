    "Content": "<p>Updated August 5, 2025: We have updated the content. Thank you for your patience.</p><p><b>Introduction</b></p><p>As part of the final phase of the Viva Engage rebranding, we’re updating the email sender domains used for Viva Engage communications. This change ensures a consistent and secure brand experience across all surfaces and completes the transition from Yammer to Viva Engage.</p><p>This update was previously communicated in MC679739, “Yammer Rebranding to Viva Engage Domain Migration Update,” in October 2023.</p><p><b>When this will happen</b></p><ul><li>The email sender domain rollout will begin in late August 2025 for U.S. and EU tenants currently receiving messages from @yammer.com and @eu.yammer.com respectively. The entire rollout is expected to complete by the end of October 2025.\n</li><li>A fallback/coexistence period will be in place between August and the end of October, during which both the old and new domains will be supported. During this time, some users within a tenant may receive emails from the old domain while others receive them from the new domain.</li></ul><p></p><p><b>How this will affect your organization</b></p><p>The sender domain for Viva Engage emails will change as follows:\n</p><ul><li>From @yammer.com to @engage.mail.microsoft for U.S. and global regions.\n</li><li>From @eu.yammer.com to @eu.engage.mail.microsoft for European regions.\n</li></ul><p>These new domains are secured with industry-standard authentication protocols (e.g., SPF) to help prevent spoofing and ensure reliable delivery.\n</p><p>To enhance security and reduce cross-tenant spam, sender addresses will now include a tenant-specific prefix. You may see emails from:\n</p><ul><li>noreply_tenant@engage.mail.microsoft (digests and delegate notifications)\n</li><li>notifications_tenant@engage.mail.microsoft (community, storyline, and activity notifications)\n</li><li>announcements_tenant@engage.mail.microsoft (leadership announcements)\n</li></ul><p>These changes apply to all Viva Engage tenants, regardless of license tier (e.g., Viva P1, P2), and affect all Viva Engage emails, including notifications, announcements, and digests.</p><p>Third-party integrations (e.g., journaling, archiving, or routing systems) that rely on the @yammer.com domain for classification or authentication may be impacted. Any such configurations should be reviewed and updated to recognize the new domains.</p><p><i>An example of a new Viva Engage email notification sent from the updated @engage.mail.microsoft domain:</i></p><p><i>&nbsp;</i><img src=\"https://cxcs.microsoft.net/static/public/messagecenter/neutral/55498900-45c4-4375-be35-b989948d2946/c7973dd8d9bde265ced10161ed090ee81bad55cb.png\" style=\"width: 400px;\" alt=\"user settings\"></p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare</b></p><p>Admins should review and update the following configurations:\n</p><ul><li>Transport rules and email gateways: Update any rules that reference @yammer.com to include the new domains.\n</li><li>Exchange filtering: Ensure filtering rules remain effective with the new sender domains.\n</li><li>Outlook rules: Inform users that any rules based on @yammer.com will no longer apply. Users can manually update or remove these rules.\n</li></ul><p>No admin action is required unless your organization has custom configurations based on the old domain.</p><p>Learn more:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/viva_engage_blog/yammer-is-evolving-to-viva-engage/3738825\" target=\"_blank\">Yammer is evolving to Viva Engage | Viva Engage Blog</a></p><p><b>Compliance considerations</b></p><p>No compliance considerations identified, review as appropriate for your organization.</p><p></p>",
