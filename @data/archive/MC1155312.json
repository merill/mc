Thank you for your patience.&nbsp;<br><br><b><b>Introduction</b></b>\n<p>Weâ€™re introducing Knowledge Agent, a built-in SharePoint capability that helps organizations prepare content for AI at scale. It unifies fragmented AI features into a single, context-aware interface that adapts to user roles and surfaces intelligent actions directly in the flow of work. This enhancement supports high-quality, trustworthy responses from Microsoft 365 Copilot and custom agents.</p>\n\n<b><b>When this will happen:</b></b>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Public Preview (Worldwide):</b> Begins mid-September 2025; completes by late February 2026.</li>\n</ul><p><b><b>How this affects your organization:</b></b></p><p><b>Who is affected:</b></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Users with a Microsoft 365 Copilot license on tenants opted into Knowledge Agent preview.</li>\n<li>Admins managing SharePoint content and agents.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><b>What will happen:</b></p>\n<ul>\n<li>A floating button will appear in the lower-right corner of SharePoint surfaces, launching a context-aware menu with intelligent actions.</li>\n<li>Role-based capabilities include:\n  <ul>\n    <li>Content managers can structure, tag, and enrich content using smart metadata and AI recommendations.</li>\n    <li>Site owners can identify stale pages, broken links, and content gaps.</li>\n    <li>Content creators can generate pages and documents using natural language prompts.</li>\n    <li>Collaborators and viewers can surface grounded insights via natural language chat.</li>\n  </ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><b>Impact to SharePoint agents users:</b></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Ready-made SharePoint site agents are now exclusively available to customers with Microsoft 365 Copilot licenses.
