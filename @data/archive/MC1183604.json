    "Content": "We are announcing the deprecation of the Edit your app with Copilot in Power Apps Studio (preview) in canvas apps. The deprecation will begin on January 6, 2026, and will remove the <a href=\"https://aka.ms/12726/ai-edit-app\" target=\"_blank\">Maker Copilot chat sidecar</a> (accessed by a Copilot button entry point in the header) from the Canvas App studio.<br><br> \n\n<b>How does this affect me? </b><br> \n\nThe Maker Copilot header button will be removed from the Canvas App studio. Makers will no longer be able to invoke Copilot from the header sidecar or via shortcut/URL.<br><br> \n\nApp creation, editing, and publishing will continue to function normally. No existing apps will be impacted. <br><br> \n\n<b>What do I need to do to prepare? </b><br> \n\nNo action is required. This change is limited to the Maker Copilot chat sidecar entry point. Users can continue to use other Maker and publishing workflows without interruption and continue to create new apps conversationally using the Copilot in Table Designer, and Plan Designer.",
