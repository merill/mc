    "Content": "<p>Updated October 10, 2024: We have updated the rollout timeline below. Thank you for your patience.</p><p>Today, users can share content to a Microsoft Teams meeting directly from a standalone webapp (in the browser) if developers have embedded a <i>Share-in-Meeting</i> control in their webapps. Today, this control allows users to share content only to an ongoing Teams meeting (or a new ad-hoc meeting) on the same device. In this rollout, we will retain the control's existing capabilities, and we will enhance the control to enable users to share content to a meeting scheduled for the future. We will combine the <i>Share-in-Meeting</i> controls with the existing S<i>hare to Teams</i> dialog box, so users can use one dialog box to share from a Teams app to Teams chats, channels, or meetings. We are also introducing the ability for users to choose <i>Present Now</i> from the dialog to present content&nbsp;in a Teams meeting.&nbsp;Developers can choose to opt into the features in this rollout. This rollout applies to Teams for Windows, the web, and Mac.</p><p>This message is associated with Microsoft 365 Roadmap ID <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?filters=&amp;searchterms=394670\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); font-family: sans-serif; font-weight: 400;\">394670</a>.\n</p><p><b>When this will happen:</b>\n</p><p>Public Developer Preview: We will begin rolling out early June 2024 and expect to complete by mid-June 2024.\n</p><p>Targeted Release: We will begin rolling out early September 2024 (previously early August) and expect to complete by mid-October 2024 (previously mid-September).\n</p><p>General Availability (Worldwide, GCC): We will begin rolling out mid-September 2024 (previously mid-August) and expect to complete by late October 2024 (previously late September).\n</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b>\n</p><p>Additional enhancements for developers in this this rollout:\n</p><ul><li>When a meeting begins, the app side panel is opened automatically for the user who shared the content to the meeting.\n</li><li>Exposes shared content information for the app to get the list of content shared, display the content, and have it readily available in the side panel.\n</li><li>Notifies the meeting participants through an experience in the meeting chat that a user has shared content in the meeting.\n</li></ul><p>App developers can embed the Share to Teams control on their external webapp:\n</p><p><img src=\"https://img-prod-cms-rt-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/cms/api/am/imageFileData/RW1lNMJ?ver=2000\" style=\"width: 400px;\" alt=\"user controls\">\n</p><p>Using the<i> Share to Teams</i> control, users can select a chat, channel, or meeting to share their content to.
