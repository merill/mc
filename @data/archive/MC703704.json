Thank you for your patience.</p><p><b>Note:</b> If you are not a multi-tenant organization, you can safely ignore this message.</p><p>This release features user experience improvements when Microsoft Teams users interact with users in another tenant that belongs to their organization (e.g., for conglomerates, as a result of M&amp;A).&nbsp;<br></p><ul><li>We are now removing any possibility of having 1:1 chat (between users from different MTO tenants) split across multiple threads.
