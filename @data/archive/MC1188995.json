    "Content": "<p><b><b>Introduction</b></b></p>\n<p>The <b>cloud.microsoft</b> domain was <a href=\"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-365-blog/introducing-cloud-microsoft-a-unified-domain-for-microsoft-365/ba-p/3804961\" target=\"_blank\">provisioned in early 2023</a> to provide a unified, trusted, and dedicated DNS domain space to host Microsoft’s first-party authenticated SaaS products and experiences. This post is to inform you that the following Microsoft products and scenarios are now available at the<b> cloud.microsoft</b> domain, in parallel with the previous domains:</p><ul><li>Microsoft Outlook (https://outlook.cloud.microsoft/)&nbsp;</li><li>Microsoft To Do (https://todo.cloud.microsoft/)</li></ul><p>\n<b><b>When this will happen</b></b></p>\n<ul>\n<li>The services listed above are already available on <b>cloud.microsoft</b>, in parallel with their previous domains.</li>\n<li>Outlook is currently rolling out under <b>Targeted Release</b> and will expand to <b>Standard Release</b> in the coming months.</li>\n<li>Users will begin seeing Outlook redirect from its old domains to <b>outlook.cloud.microsoft</b> as part of this change.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><b><b>How this affects your organization</b></b></p>\n<p><b>Who is affected:</b></p>\n<ul>\n<li>All users accessing Microsoft Outlook and Microsoft To Do.</li>\n<li>Admins managing organizational URLs, Teams apps, and network configurations.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><b>What will happen:</b></p>\n<ul>\n<li>The <b>cloud.microsoft</b> domain has been a part of standard <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/enterprise/urls-and-ip-address-ranges\" target=\"_blank\">Microsoft network guidance on domains and service endpoints</a> since April 2023. If you are currently following this guidance, <b>this change should not impact users in your organization using the above applications under the new domain.</b></li><li>Users will be redirected to applications under <b>cloud.microsoft</b> domains gradually and automatically. </li><li>No specific user action is required. </li><li>Links to the previous domains are backwards compatible and continue to be supported. </li><li>Users may notice that the new application domains are lacking the “.com” extension.  This is by design, as “.microsoft” is Microsoft’s own top-level domain – and this exclusivity allows for additional security and protection against spoofing.&nbsp;</li></ul>\n\n<p><b><b>What you can do to prepare</b></b></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Educate users about the new <b>cloud.microsoft</b> domain and its purpose. Refer them to <a href=\"https://support.microsoft.com/office/what-is-cloud-microsoft-7ba4c8b9-d062-4444-84a5-fca6c3006d2b\">What is cloud.microsoft? - Microsoft Support</a>.</li>\n<li>Update internal documentation and assets that reference old URLs to avoid confusion.</li>\n<li>Partner with developers of in-house Teams apps to ensure compatibility with the new domain. Refer to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://devblogs.microsoft.com/microsoft365dev/action-required-ensure-your-microsoft-teams-apps-are-ready-for-upcoming-domain-changes/\">Action required: ensure your Microsoft Teams apps are ready for upcoming domain changes</a> for details.</li>\n<li>Verify network configurations to ensure connections to <code>*.cloud.microsoft</code> are not blocked. If you follow <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/enterprise/urls-and-ip-address-ranges\" target=\"_blank\">standard Microsoft network guidance</a>, no action is needed.</li>\n<li>Admins can disable redirects to <code>teams.cloud.microsoft</code> if necessary using the control in the Teams Admin portal.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><b><b>Compliance considerations</b></b></p>\n<p>No compliance considerations identified; review as appropriate for your organization.</p>",
