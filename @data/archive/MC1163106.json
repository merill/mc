    "Content": "We are announcing the ability to update knowledge bases using Customer Knowledge Management Agent in Dynamics 365 Contact Center. This feature will reach general availability on October 31, 2025.<br><br> \n\n<b>How does this affect me? </b><br> \n\nThis feature allows the Customer Knowledge Management Agent to analyze the case and case-related notes, conversations, and emails in real-time to draft a knowledge article that fills knowledge gaps. <br><br> \n\nThe Customer Knowledge Management Agent compares the content of the case against your Dynamics knowledge base to determine if a new article is needed, while also ensuring that content isn't duplicated. It ensures compliance by scrubbing sensitive data, and it can be extended with custom automated compliance checks from your organization. It can automatically publish the article, if configured to do so, and make the article accessible to both support representatives, Copilot, and even self-service portals depending on your configuration. <br><br> \n\nThis feature will be automatically available to supervisors using Customer Knowledge Management Agent. Supervisors can always review, edit, and monitor Customer Knowledge Management Agent's work. <br><br> \n\n<b>What action do I need to take? </b><br> \nThis message is for awareness, and no action is required.<br><br> \n\nIf you would like more information on this feature, please visit <a href=\"https://aka.ms/12182/update-knowledge-base-using-customer-knowledge-management-agent\" target=\"_blank\">Update knowledge base using Customer Knowledge Management Agent</a>.",
