Thank you for your patience.&nbsp;</p><p><b><b>Introduction</b></b></p><p>To improve collaboration and streamline meeting workflows, Microsoft Teams is introducing the ability to consult and merge <b>Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN)</b> callers into active meetings—even when those callers are behind auto-attendants or <b>Interactive Voice Response (IVR)</b> systems that require <b>Dual-Tone Multi-Frequency (DTMF)</b> navigation. This enhancement allows users to reach subject matter experts via dial-in and seamlessly bring them into the broader conversation.</p><p><img src=\"https://cxcs.microsoft.net/file/ccp/en-us/28c569b3-f26c-4b4b-a377-ab56fafde6b4\" style=\"width: 400px;\" alt=\"user settings\"></p><p></p><p>This message is associated with Microsoft 365 Roadmap ID <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?filters=&amp;searchterms=518218\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"\">518218</a>.</p><b><b>When this will happen:</b></b><ul>\n<li><b style=\"\">Targeted Release:</b> Rolling out early March (previously early February), expected to complete by mid-March 2026 (previously mid-February).</li>\n<li><b>General Availability:</b>&nbsp; Rolling out late March (previously mid-February), expected to complete by early April 2026 (previously end of February).</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><b><b>How this affects your organization:</b></b></p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Who is affected: </b>All Microsoft Teams users who initiate or manage meetings with <b>PSTN</b> participants.
