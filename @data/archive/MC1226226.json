Thank you for your patience.&nbsp;</p><p><b><b>Introduction</b></b></p><p>\nWe are introducing a new <b>Microsoft Purview Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)</b> role—<b>Purview Agent Deployment</b>—and adding it to several existing Purview built‑in role groups. This update enables analysts who intend to work with Purview agents to also deploy them directly without requiring administrator involvement. This change improves onboarding efficiency and supports broader adoption of Purview’s AI‑powered agent capabilities.</p><p>This post is related to <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?searchterms=551147#Roadmap\">Roadmap ID 551147</a>.</p><p><b><b>When this will happen:</b></b></p><p>General Availability (Worldwide): Rollout begins <b>late February 2026</b> and is expected to complete by <b>mid‑March 2026</b>.</p>\n\n<p><b><b>How this will affect your organization:</b></b></p>\n\n<p><b>Who is affected:</b><br>\nAdmins and analysts who intend to use Microsoft Purview agents or manage Purview role groups.</p>\n\n<p><b>What will happen:</b></p>\n<ul>\n  <li>The new <b>Purview Agent Deployment</b> role will be added to these built‑in role groups:\n    <ul>\n      <li>Compliance Administrator</li>\n      <li>Data Security Management</li>\n      <li>Information Protection</li>\n      <li>Information Protection Analysts</li>\n      <li>Information Protection Investigators</li>\n      <li>Insider Risk Management</li>\n      <li>Insider Risk Management Analyst</li>\n      <li>Insider Risk Management Investigator</li><li>Purview Agent Management</li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n  <li>The <b>Purview Agent Management</b> role group will continue to include Purview Content Analyst role and maintain access to Posture agent capabilities.</li>\n  <li>Users assigned to these role groups will be able to deploy, use, and manage Purview agents end‑to‑end, including:\n    <ul>\n      <li><b>Data Security Triage Agent (DLP)</b></li>\n      <li><b>Data Security Triage Agent (IRM)</b></li>\n      <li><b>Data Security Posture Agent (DSPM)</b></li>\n      <li>Future agents as released</li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n  <li>No default data access permissions are changed.</li>\n  <li>No additional visibility into customer content is added.</li>\n  <li>Organizations can optionally enforce separation of deployment vs. analysis roles using custom role groups.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><b><b>What you can do to prepare:</b></b></p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Analysts assigned to built‑in Purview role groups will automatically be able to deploy agents.</li>\n  <li>If restricting agent deployment:\n    <ul>\n      <li>Create a custom role group without the Purview Agent Deployment role.</li>\n      <li>Assign analysts accordingly.</li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n  <li>Ensure custom groups include the Purview Agent Deployment role only where intended.</li>\n  <li>Review and update internal RBAC documentation, training, and onboarding materials.</li>\n  </ul><p>Learn more: <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/defender-office-365/scc-permissions?toc=%2Fpurview%2Ftoc.json&amp;bc=%2Fpurview%2Fbreadcrumb%2Ftoc.json\" target=\"_blank\">Roles and role groups in Microsoft Defender for Office 365 and Microsoft Purview | Microsoft Learn</a></p><ul>\n</ul>\n\n<p><b><b>Compliance considerations:</b></b></p>\n\n<table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"6\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n  <tbody><tr>\n    <th><b>Question</b></th>\n    <th><b>Explanation</b></th>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Does the change alter how existing customer data is processed, stored, or accessed?</td>\n    <td>Purview Agents may process or access existing customer data (for example, DLP, IRM, and DSPM signals) during triage and security posture workflows.
