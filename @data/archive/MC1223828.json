    "Content": "<p><b><b>Introduction</b></b></p><p>As Microsoft Teams calling adoption continues to grow across organizations, scam and phishing attempts targeting users through voice calls are increasing as well. Currently, users have no simple way to report suspicious calls, leaving organizations without visibility into these threats and without clear guidance on how users should respond.&nbsp;</p><p>To address this gap, we're introducing <b>Report a Call </b>in <i>Microsoft Teams</i>. With this feature, users can flag suspicious or unwanted one-to-one calls directly in<i> Teams</i>, giving your security team actionable intelligence and helping build organization-wide protection against bad actors.&nbsp;</p><p>This message relates to Microsoft 365 Roadmap ID&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?filters=&amp;searchterms=536573\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); font-family: sans-serif; font-weight: 400;\">536573</a>.</p>\n\n<p><b><b>When this will happen</b></b>\n</p><p><b>Targeted Release: </b>Rollout will begin in&nbsp;<b>mid-March 2026 </b>and will be completed in&nbsp;<b>late March 2026</b>.</p><p><b>General Availability (Worldwide): </b>Rollout will begin in <b>mid-April 2026</b> and is expected to be completed in <b>late April 2026</b>.</p>\n\n<p><b><b>How this will affect your organization</b></b></p>\n\n<p><i>Who is affected:</i>\nUsers who make or receive calls in <i>Microsoft Teams</i> on Windows, Mac, and Web.</p>\n\n<p><i>What will happen:</i></p>\n<ul>\n  <li>A new <b>Report a Call </b>option will appear in<i> Teams call history </i>for one-to-one calls only (<b>ON by default </b>on the Teams client).</li><li>Users will be able to click <b><i>more options </i></b>next to any call and select <b><i>Report a Call</i></b>.</li><li>Relevant call metadata and limited contextual information will be securely shared with your organization and Microsoft.</li><li>Security teams will view detailed reported instances in the <i>Microsoft Defender portal</i>, which will require Defender for Office 365 (Plan 1 or Plan 2) or Defender XDR.</li><li>Information about user-submitted reports will be available in <i>Teams Admin Center</i> under Protection reports &gt; User-reported security submissions.&nbsp;</li><li>Admins will be able to investigate and take appropriate action.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><b><b>What you can do to prepare</b></b></p><p>While the reporting option is<b> enabled by default </b>on Teams clients, you can configure the Microsoft Defender portal to receive and access these reports or access basic submissions data in <i>Teams admin center</i>.</p><p><b>1. For enhanced reporting, enable the setting in the&nbsp;<i>Microsoft Defender portal</i>:</b></p><ul><li>Navigate to <i><b><a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/end-user-reporting-security\" target=\"_blank\">User reporting settings</a></b></i><a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/end-user-reporting-security\" target=\"_blank\">.</a></li><li>Ensure the Teams <b><i>call reporting setting</i></b> is enabled.</li><li>Without this, detailed reported calls will not appear in the <i><a href=\"https://security.microsoft.com/reportsubmission?viewid=user\" target=\"_blank\">defender portal</a></i><a href=\"https://security.microsoft.com/reportsubmission?viewid=user\" target=\"_blank\">.</a></li></ul><p>Alternatively, you can view reports in the <i>Teams admin center</i>:</p><ul><li>Open <b><i>Teams admin center &gt; Analytics &amp; Reports &gt; Protection Reports.</i></b></li><li>Select <b><i>User-reported security submissions</i></b> from the drop-down.</li><li>Select the desired time period and interaction mode (Calls).</li></ul>\n\n<p><b>2. Prepare user communication:</b></p><ul><li>Inform users about the new<b style=\"\"> Report a Call </b>option before rollout.</li><li>Clarify when to use it: suspicious calls, potential scams, unwanted calls from external parties.</li><li>Set expectations: reporting helps the organization, not just individual complaints.</li></ul><p><b>To disable the experience on the Teams client:</b></p><ul><li>In the <i>Teams admin center</i>, under <i><b>Calling settings</b></i>, disable the <i><b>Report a Call</b></i> toggle.</li></ul><p><b><b>Compliance considerations</b></b>\n</p><p><b>Data Processing:&nbsp;</b></p><p>Limited call-related metadata is processed when a user submits a report, including:</p><ul><li>Call timestamp and duration</li><li>Caller ID information (if available)</li><li>Teams user IDs for participants</li><li>User's reason for reporting (if provided)</li></ul>",
