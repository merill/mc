    "Content": "We are announcing the ability to calculate revenue recognition for stand-alone selling price contract lines in Dynamics 365 Project Operations. This feature will reach general availability on March 13, 2026.<br><br>\n<b>How does this affect me?</b><br>\nThis feature enables users to set the contract line value on the project's contract lines. The system calculates revenue recognition based on the contract line value amount.<br><br>In revenue recognition, fixed-price billing arrangements are typically defined using billing milestones to establish the contract value. By separating the contract value from billing milestones, this feature allows users to recognize revenue based on the effort or stand-alone selling price. This approach aligns better with ASC 606 and IFRS 15 requirements.<br><br>\n</ul><b>What action do I need to take?</b><br>\nThis message is for awareness, and no action is required.<br><br>\nIf you would like more information on this feature, please visit <a href=\"https://aka.ms/ADO13780\"target=\"_blank\">Calculate revenue recognition for stand-alone selling price contract lines</a>.",
