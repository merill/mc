This feature will reach general availability on October 31, 2025.<br><br> \n\n<b>How does this affect me?</b><br> \n\nIn the Copilot Service admin center, you can now turn on the option to show previously closed conversations to your customers for persistent chat, chat SDK, and mobile messaging SDKs. The previous conversation appears before the latest conversation, an experience that customers intuitively understand from consumer messaging apps. Brands can opt in to this feature and choose how long to keep historic conversations.<br><br>  \n<b>What action do I need to take?</b><br> \nThis message is for awareness, and no action is required.<br><br> \nIf you would like more information on this feature, please visit <a href=\"https://aka.ms/ADO12108\"target=\"_blank\">View previously closed persistent conversations</a>.",
