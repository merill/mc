    "Content": "<p>Updated January 16, 2025: We have updated the rollout timeline below. Thank you for your patience.</p><p>As an extension to the previous communication MC757613 <i>(Updated) Microsoft SharePoint: Add approvals to any SharePoint list</i> (originally sent March 2024, updated August 2024), we will soon add approvals to document libraries in Microsoft SharePoint Online.\n</p><p>This message is associated with Microsoft 365 Roadmap ID <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?filters=&amp;searchterms=420336\" target=\"_blank\">420336</a>.\n</p><p><b>When this will happen:</b>\n</p><p>Targeted Release: We will begin rolling out late January 2025 (previously early January) and expect to complete by early March 2025 (previously late January).</p><p>General Availability (Worldwide, GCC): We will begin rolling out early March 2025 (early January) and expect to complete by late March 2025 (late January).\n</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b>\n</p><p>Before this rollout: Users are not able to add approvals to document libraries in SharePoint Online. \n</p><p>After this rollout, users will be able to configure approvals by going to the <i>Automate</i> dropdown menu from the command bar in SharePoint Online document libraries and then selecting the <i>Configure Approvals</i> option to enable and disable approvals on the library. Note: When editing files, any in-flight approvals will be cancelled if changes are saved. To discourage edits of in-progress approvals, files will open in view-only mode in Microsoft Word, Excel, and PowerPoint for the web, and the same Windows desktop applications will show that the document is <i>Marked as final.\n</i></p><p>After approvals are enabled, a user can create a file and submit it for approval. By creating an approval request and specifying the approver, the request will appear in the <i>Approvals</i> app in Microsoft Teams or can be approved directly in the library in SharePoint. Once approved, the file metadata is updated.\n</p><p>Note: Disabling approvals will only hide the relevant columns. In-progress approvals will still be actionable in Teams. At any time, you can manually add approvals columns back into your views.\n</p><p>Configure approvals in SharePoint Online:\n</p><p><img src=\"https://cxcs.microsoft.net/file/messagecenter/en-us/b2c82c8d-a68f-4d7f-9f12-18729645e663\" style=\"width: 400px;\" alt=\"user controls\">\n</p><p>Enable configured approvals:\n</p><p><img src=\"https://cxcs.microsoft.net/file/messagecenter/en-us/e185b33e-aa5a-407b-ba1e-7d89ba9f6719\" style=\"width: 400px;\" alt=\"user controls\">\n</p><p>Approvals column:\n</p><p><img src=\"https://cxcs.microsoft.net/file/messagecenter/en-us/c425d2cf-f73c-41dd-96f6-ee8d162f0588\" style=\"width: 400px;\" alt=\"user controls\">\n</p><p>Disable configured approvals:\n</p><p><img src=\"https://cxcs.microsoft.net/file/messagecenter/en-us/eb94cc69-85b9-441d-8fd1-bd4b24ec1e43\" style=\"width: 400px;\" alt=\"user controls\">\n</p><p>This feature is on by default.\n</p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b>\n</p><p>This rollout will happen automatically by the specified date with no admin action required before the rollout.\n</p><p>Inform your users of the new <i>Approvals</i> functionality for libraries and lists.
