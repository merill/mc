Note: When editing files, any in-flight approvals will be cancelled if changes are saved. To discourage edits of in-progress approvals, files will open in view-only mode in Microsoft Word, Excel, and PowerPoint for the web, and the same Windows desktop applications will show that the document is <i>Marked as final.\n</i></p><p>After approvals are enabled, a user can create a file and submit it for approval. By creating an approval request and specifying the approver, the request will appear in the <i>Approvals</i> app in Microsoft Teams or can be approved directly in the library in SharePoint. Once approved, the file metadata is updated.\n</p><p>Note: Disabling approvals will only hide the relevant columns. In-progress approvals will still be actionable in Teams. At any time, you can manually add approvals columns back into your views.\n</p><p>Configure approvals in SharePoint Online:\n</p><p><img src=\"https://img-prod-cms-rt-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/cms/api/am/imageFileData/RW1pGUi?ver=8b9c\" style=\"width: 400px;\" alt=\"user controls\">\n</p><p>Enable configured approvals:\n</p><p><img src=\"https://img-prod-cms-rt-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/cms/api/am/imageFileData/RW1pBcR?ver=bb9c\" style=\"width: 400px;\" alt=\"user controls\">\n</p><p>Approvals column:\n</p><p><img src=\"https://img-prod-cms-rt-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/cms/api/am/imageFileData/RW1pN1V?ver=8469\" style=\"width: 400px;\" alt=\"user controls\">\n</p><p>Disable configured approvals:\n</p><p><img src=\"https://img-prod-cms-rt-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/cms/api/am/imageFileData/RW1pGT9?ver=b040\" style=\"width: 400px;\" alt=\"user controls\">\n</p><p>This feature is on by default.\n</p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b>\n</p><p>This rollout will happen automatically by the specified date with no admin action required before the rollout.\n</p><p>Inform your users of the new <i>Approvals</i> functionality for libraries and lists.
