For example, you could assign an Exchange Online Plan 1 or 2 license, or a Microsoft 365 or Office 365 E3 or E5 license.\n</p><p>\n</p><p>Starting March 1, 2026, requests to use EWS without a suitable license will result in a HTTP 403 response. </p><p>Learn more: <a href=\"https://aka.ms/EWSLicenseChanges\" target=\"_blank\">Update to EWS Access for Kiosk / Frontline Worker Licensed Users</a>&nbsp;</p>",
