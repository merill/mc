    "Content": "We are announcing the ability to automate case lifecycle tasks with Case Management Agent, which automates case creation and updates, facilitates collaboration with experts, and streamlines the case follow-up and closure process in Dynamics 365 Customer Service. This feature will reach general availability on October 31, 2025.<br><br><b>How does this affect me?</b><br>The Case Management Agent provides the following capabilities:<ul>\n<li><b>Automate case creation and case details during live chats and from incoming emails</b>:When a customer service representative accepts a live chat, the Case Management Agent will automatically create a case and fill in the required information. When the conversation ends, the agent automatically updates the case fields. When automatic record creation (ARC) rules convert an email into a case, the system automatically extracts the required information from the email and populates case fields. The case will stay up to date as the customer sends new emails.</li>\n<li><b>Automate case resolution</b>: Once the case is created and updated, the Case Management Agent will leverage <i>identified intent</i> to autonomously draft and send email responses after a case is created. This ensures timely communication and resolution of customer issues with minimal human intervention.</li>\n<li><b>Automate case follow-up and closure</b>: Once resolution is provided, the Case Management Agent sends follow-up emails. When a customer responds, the agent resolves the case or will alert the service representative when needed. These capabilities boost efficiency and closure to reduce case handling time.</li></ul><b>What action do I need to take?</b><br>This message is for awareness, and no action is required.<br><br>If you would like more information on this feature, please visit <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://aka.ms/12110\">Set up Case Management Agent for case creation and update (preview)</a>.",
