    "Content": "We are announcing the ability to automate case lifecycle tasks with Case Management Agent, which automates case creation and updates, facilitates collaboration with experts, and streamlines the case follow-up and closure process in Dynamics 365 Customer Service. This feature will reach general availability on October 31, 2025.<br><br><b>How does this affect me?</b><br>The Case Management Agent provides the following capabilities:<ul><li><b>Automate case creation and case details during live chats and from incoming emails:</b> When a customer service representative accepts a live chat, the Case Management Agent will automatically create a case and fill in the required information. As the conversation continues, representatives can use the agent to update case fields in real time. When the conversation ends, the agent automatically updates the case fields.<br><br>When automatic record creation (ARC) rules convert an email into a case, the system automatically extracts the required information from the email. The case will stay up to date as the customer sends new emails.</li><li><b>Uses AI for email classification to categorize incoming emails into predefined categories:</b> With this classification, you can automate support workflows to help optimize support processes, improve productivity, and reduce operational costs. For example, you can skip case creation for \"thank you\" emails or marketing spam emails and create cases only for relevant inquiries.</li><li><b>Intelligent collaboration prompts with one click:</b> Automatically finds the right experts and creates a concise case summary to help collaborators get up to speed quickly. The case timeline captures collaboration insights, which streamlines future processes. In addition, the collaboration summaries integrate into the application, enhancing the knowledge base and minimizing the need for future collaborations.</li><li><b>Tracks cases that need attention:</b> It sends follow-up emails based on SLA criteria. When a customer responds, the agent resolves the case or alerts the service representative. These capabilities boost the efficiency of case creation and closure to reduce case handling time.</li></ul><b>What action do I need to take?</b><br>This message is for awareness, and no action is required.<br><br>If you would like more information on this feature, please visit <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://aka.ms/12110\">Set up Case Management Agent for case creation and update (preview)</a>.",
