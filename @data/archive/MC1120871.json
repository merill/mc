Thank you for your patience.</p><p><b>What and Who</b></p><p></p><p>To enhance the security and integrity of Microsoft Teams meetings, we are introducing a new feature that validates Teams meeting join URLs. This update helps ensure that meeting links are not altered or rewritten by security products in ways that could render them unusable or flagged as malicious.\n\n</p><p><b>Rollout Schedule</b></p><p></p><ul><li><b>Worldwide:</b> September 30, 2025</li>\n<li><b>GCC, GCC High, DoD:</b> November 30, 2025</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p></p><p><b>Impact on Your Organization</b><b><br></b></p><ul><li><b>Who is affected:</b> <ul><li>o\tOrganizations using security products that inspect or rewrite URLs, and users who join Microsoft Teams meetings via meeting links.</li></ul></li></ul><p></p><ul>\n<li><b>What will happen:</b>\n  <ul>\n    <li>Microsoft Teams will validate join URLs to ensure they have not been modified.\n</li><li>If a join URL is rewritten or altered by a security product, it may be marked as malicious.\n</li><li>Users may be prevented from joining meetings if URLs are not in their original format.\n</li><li>This feature is enabled by default and does not require admin configuration.</li></ul></li></ul><p>Note: Meeting joins will only be blocked if the join links are re-written in the calendar event details (Join URL).
