    "Content": "<p>Updated September 24, 2025: We have updated the content. Thank you for your patience.</p><p><b>Introduction</b></p><p>We have identified that some tenants are using DLP rules in which alert generation has been enabled using the Microsoft Purview portal policy configuration page but the corresponding Alert Policy (Protection Alert) was disabled or deleted using <b>\"Set-ProtectionAlert\"</b> PowerShell cmdlet (<a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/module/exchangepowershell/set-protectionalert?view=exchange-ps\" target=\"_blank\">Learn more</a>). Due to this the alert generation gets turned off for the associated DLP rule – even though the alert it appears active on Purview portal policy configuration UX.</p><p>If you wish to continue receive alerts for these rules, please take one of the following actions:\n</p><ul><li>Open the rule in the Purview portal, make any update, and save the configuration.\n</li><li>Use the PowerShell cmdlets to re-enable alert generation for the rule. (<a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/module/exchangepowershell/set-dlpcompliancerule?view=exchange-ps\" target=\"_blank\">Learn more</a>)</li></ul><p><b>When this will happen</b></p><p>This change will begin rolling out on September 26, 2025.</p><p><b>How this affects your organization</b></p><p>To ensure consistency we will update the DLP rule to remove Generate Alert as an action. Since alerts were disabled using Protection Alert PowerShell cmdlets there will be no change in alert generation behavior for corresponding DLP rule and policy. We are only ensuring there is consistency between DLP rules (with Generate Alert as an action) and their corresponding Alert policies (protection alert)</p><p><b>What you can do to prepare:</b></p><p>If you wish to receive alerts for these rules, please take one of the following actions:</p><ul><li> Open the rule in the Purview portal, make any update, and save the configuration.</li><li>Use the PowerShell cmdlet “Set-DlpComplianceRule” to re-enable alert generation for the rule. (<a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/module/exchangepowershell/set-dlpcompliancerule?view=exchange-ps\" target=\"_blank\">Learn more</a>).</li></ul><p></p><ul></ul><p></p><p><b>Compliance considerations</b></p><table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"6\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n<tbody><tr>\n<th>Compliance Area</th>\n<th>Impact</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Alters how existing customer data is processed, stored, or accessed</td>\n<td>No affect.</td></tr><tr><td>Modifies Purview capabilities</td>\n<td>No affect.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Alters how admins can monitor, report on, or demonstrate compliance activities</td>\n<td>No affect.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Includes an admin control</td>\n<td>Admins can re-enable alert generation if they wish to via portal or Set-\"DlpComplianceRule\"   PowerShell cmdlet.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Allows user to enable/disable the feature</td>\n<td>Admins can re-enable alert generation if they wish to via portal or Set-\"DlpComplianceRule\" PowerShell cmdlet.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>",
