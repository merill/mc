    "Content": "<p>Updated October 17, 2025: We have updated the timeline. Thank you for your patience.</p><p><b>Introduction\n</b></p><p>We’re introducing a new Workflows experience in Microsoft Teams that is rebuilt from the ground up based on feedback.&nbsp;</p><p>The Workflows app helps you automate repetitive tasks and streamline everyday processes across Teams and Microsoft 365. Whether you're scheduling messages, managing approvals, syncing updates across apps, or triggering actions from chat messages, Workflows makes it easy to build automations in just a few clicks. It’s powered by Power Automate and designed to help you stay focused on what matters most.</p><p>This new version addresses previous concerns around complexity and performance, delivering a faster, more intuitive, and streamlined interface. With the updated experience, users can now create powerful automations in three steps or fewer.</p><p>This release is part of our broader effort to make automation more accessible and impactful for every information worker. Whether you're new to automation or a seasoned pro, the new Workflows app is designed to meet you where you work—and help you get more done with less effort.

It introduces:\n</p><ul><li>A streamlined, performant user interface that works across Teams chats, channels, and SharePoint lists and libraries.</li><li>A redesigned template library for faster discovery of common workflows.</li><li>Natural language-to-flow capabilities that allow users to describe what they want to automate.</li><li>A Madlib-style editor that simplifies customization using plain language and dynamic placeholders.</li></ul><p>Under the hood, the new Workflows experience is still powered by Power Automate—so you get the same enterprise-grade reliability, security, and extensibility you trust. This update does not impact existing workflows or internal compliance processes. The feature will be on by default and requires no admin configuration.\n</p><p><i>i.
