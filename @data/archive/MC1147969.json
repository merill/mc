This enables clearer understanding of consents and supports more informed decision-making. From the <i>Permissions </i>tab, admins can now provide consent directly, and once granted by the <i>Global Admin</i>, the <i>AI Admin Role</i> can deploy agents.</p><p><img src=\" https://cxcs.microsoft.net/file/ccp/en-us/1dda86c9-3927-4908-9a91-a5e74423ef6c\" style=\"width: 400px;\" alt=\"user settings\"></p><p></p>\n\n<p>This message is associated with Roadmap ID <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?filters=&amp;searchterms=502617\" target=\"_blank\">502617</a>.</p><p><b><b>When this will happen:</b></b></p>\n<p>General Availability (Worldwide): Rollout will begin in mid-September 2025 and is expected to complete by late September 2025.</p>\n\n<p><b><b>How this affects your organization:</b></b></p>\n<p><b>Who is affected:</b> Admins managing agent deployment and consent in Microsoft 365.</p>\n<p><b style=\"\">What will happen:</b></p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Permissions are now surfaced earlier in the agent lifecycle, rather than being embedded in deployment stepsâ€”supporting informed decision-making.</li>\n  <li>Admins can manage these permissions directly from the Microsoft Admin Center (MAC), reducing workflow interruptions and improving operational efficiency.</li>\n  <li>The <i>AI Admin Role </i>can deploy agents once consent is granted by a <i>Global Admin</i>.</li>\n  <li>Each permission will display a risk level to help assess impact.</li>\n  <li>Automation scenarios will be available to streamline low-risk agent enablement.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><b><b>What you can do to prepare:</b></b></p>\n<ul>\n  <li><b>Provide consent from the Permissions tab:</b> Admins will be able to grant consent directly from the <i>Permissions</i> tab.
