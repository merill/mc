If the same or new email is opened again from the parent tab, it switches to the already-open shared tab.</li><li>If the parent tab is closed or refreshed, this relationship is reset. A new <i>shared email entity </i>tab will be opened the next time an email entity is accessed from the refreshed or newly opened parent tab.</li><li>Navigation positions within each email entity are retained during the session (e.g., <i>Analysis</i> tab vs.<i> Timeline</i> tab).</li><li>A new “<i>Email preview</i>” tab is added alongside “<i>Similar emails</i>,” allowing persistent preview even when switching tabs.</li><li>Each email entity now has a unique URL, enabling direct sharing via Teams or opening in a new browser tab.</li></ul><p></p><p><img src=\"https://cxcs.microsoft.net/static/public/messagecenter/neutral/4e087368-68a0-41a3-9b6e-ea0d07bea7dd/89552fcb720648483ad735ae39d14cde7ca6264a.png\" style=\"width: 400px;\" alt=\"user settings\"></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p><img src=\"https://cxcs.microsoft.net/static/public/messagecenter/neutral/7d728fd9-b810-467b-a97c-f358ab24f661/d162ea4208df7f6f896541d3d8cd2da7fbccb89b.png\" style=\"width: 400px;\" alt=\"user settings\"></p><p></p><p><b>What you can do to prepare:</b></p><ul><li>No action is required from end users or administrators.</li><li>You may wish to inform helpdesk staff of the new navigation behavior for email entities.</li></ul><p><b></b></p><p>Learn more: <b>to be updated</b>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/defender-office-365/mdo-email-entity-page\" target=\"_blank\">The Email entity page in Microsoft Defender for Office 365 - Microsoft Defender for Office | Microsoft Learn</a></p><p><b>Compliance considerations:</b></p><p>No compliance considerations identified, review as appropriate for your organization.</p>",
