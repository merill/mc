Users can quickly access frequently used groups, recent files across the groups, discover new groups based on their interests.</li><li>In the updated<i>&nbsp;</i>groups, users can easily create, consume, and share information related to a group and more efficiently manage events and members with fewer clicks. \n</li><li>Users can navigate to a group from the left navigation or from recent groups.
