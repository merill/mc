Before this rollout, both <code>OWAEnabled</code> and <code>OneWinNativeOutlookEnabled</code> policies are checked. After this rollout, we will remove the check for <code>OWAEnabled</code> so you can have the chance to enable new Outlook and still disable Outlook for the web if desired.\n</p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b>\n</p><p>This rollout will happen automatically by the specified date with no admin action required before the rollout. Review your current configuration to determine the impact for your organization. You may want to notify your admins about this change and update any relevant documentation.\n</p><p>After this change takes effect, please confirm the <code>OneWinNativeOutlookEnabled</code> policy state for each mailbox. The default value is <code>Enabled</code>.\n</p><p><i>Learn more</i></p><ul><li><a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/exchange/clients/outlook-on-the-web/mailbox-access\" target=\"_blank\">Enable or disable Outlook on the web access to mailboxes in Exchange Server | Microsoft Learn</a>&nbsp;(will be updated before rollout)</li><li><a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/exchange/clients-and-mobile-in-exchange-online/outlook-on-the-web/enable-disable-employee-access-new-outlook\" target=\"_blank\">Enable or disable access to the new Outlook for Windows | Microsoft Learn</a>&nbsp;(will be updated before rollout)</li></ul><p>#newoutlookforwindows</p>",
