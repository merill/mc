This lets users use their Copilot value on any document to which they have permission. Note that Copilot data protection is always based on the identity used to access the file. This ensures enterprise data protection for files in your organization, regardless of which account grants Copilot access. The setting for web grounding in Copilot is also based on the identity used to access the file. If you disabled web grounding in Copilot, users will not be able to use web grounding even when using Copilot access from another account.  This feature will be available starting in March 2025, at which point, users signed into accounts with external Copilot licenses will be able to use Copilot on their work and school documents in Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook and OneNote desktop and mobile apps.</p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare</b> \n</p><p>If you wish to restrict multiple account access to Copilot, you can use the “Multiple account access to Copilot for work documents” <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoft-365-apps/admin-center/overview-cloud-policy\" target=\"_blank\">Cloud Policy</a>.&nbsp; This policy setting is expected to be available in Cloud Policy by the end of January 2025</p><p><b>Additional information</b> \n</p><p>For more information, see <a href=\"https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2300619\" target=\"_blank\">Multiple account access to Copilot for work and school documents</a>.</p>",
