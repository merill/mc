Please note that Information Barrier functionality will not be available on the Planner mobile app or when accessing Planner via mobile browsers.</p><p>This post is associated with Roadmap ID&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?filters=&amp;searchterms=499077\" target=\"_blank\">499077</a>.</p>\n\n<p><b>When this will happen</b></p><p>\n</p><ul>\n<li><b>Public Preview (Worldwide):</b> Begins early September 2025, expected to complete by September 20th 2025.</li>\n<li><b>General Availability (Worldwide):</b> Begins September 22nd 2025, expected to complete by September 30th 2025.</li>\n</ul><p></p>\n\n<p><b>How this affects your organization</b></p><p>\nOnce enabled, Information Barrier support will automatically restrict plan sharing and task visibility to authorized user segments.
