Thank you for your patience.</p><p>Adaptive Protection integration with Microsoft Purview Data Loss Prevention will soon be available for government clouds (GCC, GCC High, and DoD).

For example, a DLP policy integrated with insider risk levels will prevent high-risk users from printing sensitive data, while allowing low-risk users to do so.\n</p><p>This message is associated with Microsoft 365 Roadmap ID <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?filters=&amp;searchterms=377674\" target=\"_blank\">377674</a>.\n</p><p><b>When this will happen:</b>\n</p><p>General Availability (GCC, GCC High, DoD): We will begin rolling out late October (previously late September) 2024 and expect to complete by late November 2024 (previously late October).&nbsp;</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b>\n</p><p>Before this rollout: Adaptive Protection integrated with Purview DLP was not available for government clouds.\n</p><p>To use Adaptive Protection integrated with Purview DLP for your organization, go to Purview &gt; <i>Insider risk management</i> &gt; and turn on <i>Adaptive Protection:</i>\n</p><p><img src=\"https://img-prod-cms-rt-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/cms/api/am/imageFileData/RW1msJJ?ver=1a25\" style=\"width: 400px;\" alt=\"admin settings\">\n</p><p>Adaptive Protection is off by default.\n</p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b>\n</p><p>This rollout will happen automatically by the specified date with no admin action required before the rollout.
