This feature will reach general availability on November 30, 2025.<br><br><b>How does this affect me?</b><br>Customer Intent Agent is part of the autonomous service agent suite and uses a consumption-based billing model on top of your base license for Dynamics 365 Contact Center. When enabled, Customer Intent Agent analyzes your existing support conversations and cases to automatically build an intent library. After the agent discovers intents, you can create a Customer Intent Agent in Copilot Studio. It uses your intent library to ask follow-up questions, provide knowledge articles, or take actions to resolve customer issues.<br><br><b>What action do I need to take?</b><br>This message is for awareness, and no action is required.<br><br>If you would like more information on this feature, please visit <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://aka.ms/ADO12107\">Resolve issues autonomously with Customer Intent Agent</a>.",
