This feature will reach general availability on September 30, 2025.<br><br><b>How does this affect me?</b><br>This feature delivers better accuracy, performance, and cost than traditional semantic-based speech-to-text (STT) AI engines. The engine processes grammars that follow the Speech Recognition Grammar Specification (SRGS) standard, which are written in an XML-based format called GrXML. The engine converts spoken audio (utterances) into text that follows the grammar's rules.<br><br><b>What action do I need to take?</b><br>This message is for awareness, and no action is required.<br><br>If you would like more information on this feature, please visit <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://aka.ms/ADO11692\">use constrained grammars for speech recognition</a>.",
