    "Content": "We are announcing the ability to configure quality evaluation framework with Quality Evaluation Agent in Dynamics 365 Customer Service. This feature will reach general availability on October 31, 2025.<br><br>\n<b>How does this affect me?</b><br>\nThe evaluation framework allows AI supervisors to define business quality standards for both customer service representatives and AI agents through detailed evaluation criteria. This feature enables autonomous and AI-assisted assessments of customer interactions across channels (cases, conversations, emails, surveys). Evaluation is comprised of three key components:<ul><li><b>Evaluation criteria</b>: Structured forms with questions, scoring logic, and instructions that define what quality means for a business. Supervisors can use out of the box criteria as guidelines or create customized criteria.</li>\n<li><b>Evaluation plans</b>: Rules that determine when and how evaluations are triggered, based on specific conditions like SLA breaches or sentiment drops. Supervisors can use on-demand evaluation to select cases and request them to be evaluated.</li>\n<li><b>Evaluations</b>: The actual scoring and analysis of interactions evaluated, producing summaries, insights, and coaching recommendations for supervisors.</li></ul>\n<b>What action do I need to take?</b><br>\nThis message is for awareness, and no action is required.<br><br>\nIf you would like more information on this feature, please visit the <a href=\"https://aka.ms/ADO12492\"target=\"_blank\">Configure quality evaluation with quality evaluation agent</a> article.",
