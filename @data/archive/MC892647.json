    "Content": "<p>Coming soon to Microsoft Teams: When users connect their laptop to a room's shared peripheral through USB, Teams will automatically detect the room's audio and recommend the room audio option on the pre-join screen to help streamline a user's entry into a <a href=\"https://support.microsoft.com/office/use-shared-display-mode-in-meeting-rooms-a59c6886-9028-44da-a3cc-5563be40a214\" target=\"_blank\">bring your own device (BYOD) meeting room</a>. If a room's audio peripherals are recognized as shared or they are on Microsoft's known BYOD peripherals list, the room audio option will be suggested to users. After users connect the peripheral to their laptop and join a meeting, users will automatically transition to the room's audio if a room's audio peripherals are recognized as shared <b>and </b>are on Microsoft's known BYOD peripherals list* <b>or</b> if the room's audio peripheral is associated** to a room via the Microsoft Teams Pro management portal. A shared peripheral is one that is being used by multiple users, which distinguishes it from a personal peripheral.
