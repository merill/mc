Thank you for your patience.\n</p><p>Beginning mid-August 2025, we're introducing a new Tools feature in the Copilot Chat prompt box.

By selecting Tools, users get a menu where they can easily discover and trigger the right Copilot feature or capability for their current task, while also providing consistent interactions across tools. Based on the user's license, Tools provides easy access to features and capabilities like Researcher, Analyst, Pages, and image generation.</p><p>This message is associated with Microsoft 365 Roadmap <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?filters=&amp;searchterms=497298\" target=\"_blank\">497298</a>.</p><p><b>When this will happen</b><br></p><p>General Availability (Worldwide): We will begin rollout late September 2025 (previously mid-September) and expect to complete by mid-October 2025 (previously late September).</p><p><b>How this affects your organization</b></p><p>Once this update is rolled out, users will see a new Tools button in the Copilot Chat prompt box.
