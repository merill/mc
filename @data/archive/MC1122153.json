    "Content": "<p>Updated August 21, 2025: We have updated the timeline. Thank you for your patience.</p><p>Beginning mid-August 2025, we're introducing a new Tools feature in the Copilot Chat prompt box. Tools acts as a lightweight entry point into high-value, task-specific Copilot features and capabilities directly from the prompt box. By selecting Tools, users get a menu where they can easily discover and trigger the right Copilot feature or capability for their current task, while also providing consistent interactions across tools. Based on the user's license, Tools provides easy access to features and capabilities like Researcher, Analyst, Pages, and image generation.</p><p><b>When this will happen</b><br></p><p>General Availability (Worldwide): We will begin rollout late August 2025 (previously mid-August) and expect to complete by early September 2025 (previously late August).</p><p><b>How this affects your organization</b></p><p>Once this update is rolled out, users will see a new Tools button in the Copilot Chat prompt box. Selecting this button opens a menu of AI-powered features tailored to the userâ€™s license. This enhancement improves discoverability and usability of Copilot capabilities, helping users complete tasks more efficiently.</p><p><img src=\"https://cxcs.microsoft.net/file/ccp/en-us/5d805de7-b16b-48ae-92e7-afc0df17e66c  \" width=\"400\" height=\"\"></p><p>This feature is on by default and does not require admin configuration.</p><p><b>What you can do to prepare</b><br></p><p>No admin action is required.
