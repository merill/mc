New actions—<i>copy file to</i>, <i>move file to</i>, and <i>set content</i> <i>type to</i>—will be available to all users with edit permissions, enabling more flexible automation based on file metadata.</p><p><b>When this will happen</b></p><p>Rollout will begin in late August 2025 and is expected to complete by early September 2025.</p><p><b>How this affects your organization</b></p><p>SharePoint users will see three new actions in the rules editor interface. These actions allow users to:</p><ul><li>Automatically copy or move files based on metadata triggers.</li><li>Set a published content type for files that meet specific criteria.</li></ul><p>Rules can be created by site owners or members with edit permissions. Destination libraries must be accessible to the rule creator and can reside in the same site or a different one. Each library can support up to 15 rules, but destination libraries cannot be targeted by multiple copy/move rules.</p><p><b>What you can do to prepare</b></p><p>We recommend informing your SharePoint users about these new capabilities and reviewing existing rules to avoid conflicts.&nbsp;</p><p>Learn more: <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/documentprocessing/content-processing-overview?view=o365-worldwide\" target=\"_blank\">Overview of content processing rules</a></p><p><b>Compliance considerations</b></p><p>No compliance considerations identified, review as appropriate for your organization.</p>",
