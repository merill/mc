    "Content": "<p>Updated October 22, 2024: We have updated the rollout timeline below. Thank you for your patience.</p><p>A new Microsoft Purview compliance portal introduces a pivotal communications enhancement that integrates Insider Risk Management (IRM) alerts within Communication Compliance (CC) triage flows, providing a holistic approach to compliance risk assessment. This integration empowers investigators with enriched insights by correlating communication alerts with a user's risk profile and activity history from IRM directly in a CC triage flow. This synergy between IRM and CC facilitates a more nuanced and informed decision-making process during investigations.&nbsp;<br></p><p>\n</p><p>This message is associated with Microsoft 365 Roadmap ID <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?filters=&amp;searchterms=408534\" target=\"_blank\">408534</a>.</p><p><b>When this will happen:</b>\n</p><p>Public Preview: We will begin rolling out early November 2024 (previously mid-October) and expect to complete by mid-November 2024 (previously late October)<br></p><p>General Availability (Worldwide): We will begin rolling out mid-December 2024 (previously mid-November and expect to complete by late December 2024 (previously late November).</p><p> <b>How this will affect your organization:</b>\n</p><p>The integration of IRM context into CC is a significant stride towards enhancing the efficacy of compliance investigations. This will allow investigators to view a user's risk profile and history alongside communication alerts, enabling a more informed and efficient triage process.\n</p><p>The insider risk severity (Low, Medium, or High) determined by activity detected in IRM policies helps to prioritize and respond to user activity accordingly. A new user activity timeline will show messages and activities from IRM in one screen, simplifying the review process. \n</p><p><img src=\"https://img-prod-cms-rt-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/cms/api/am/imageFileData/RW1nVN6?ver=3f95\" style=\"width: 500px;\"><br></p><p><br></p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b>\n</p><p>To use this feature, please connect with IRM administrators to enable <i>Data sharing</i> from IRM settings.
