The change supports broader access to generative learning tools and simplifies lesson creation workflows.</p><p><b>What is Microsoft Learning Zone?\n</b></p><p>\n</p><p><b>Microsoft Learning Zone</b> is a Windows app that enables educators to create AI-powered interactive lessons on <b>Copilot+ PC devices</b>. Using educator input, such as a lesson description, grade level, standards, and optional materials, it creates lessons with informational and exercise slides, including instant feedback on answers. Educators can modify, add, or remove slides as needed. After making their adjustments, they have options to preview the lesson, assign it to students, or share it with colleagues.</p><p><b>What is a Copilot+ PC device?</b></p><p><b>Copilot+ PCs</b> are a new category of Windows 11 devices designed to run advanced AI experiences locally. These devices feature powerful Neural Processing Units (NPUs) that enable fast, secure, and private AI-powered features—such as Recall, Live Captions, and generative lesson creation in <b>Microsoft Learning Zone</b>—without relying on cloud processing. Educators using Copilot+ PCs can generate interactive lessons directly on their device, enhancing classroom engagement and productivity.</p>\n\n<p><b><b>When this will happen:</b></b></p>\n<p>General Availability (Worldwide): We will begin rolling out early January 2026 and expect to complete by late January 2026.</p>\n\n<p><b><b>How this affects your organization:</b></b></p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Who is affected:</b> IT administrators managing Microsoft 365 Education tenants; Educators using Copilot+ PC devices</li>\n<li><b>What will happen:</b>\n  <ul>\n    <li><b>Microsoft Learning Zone</b> will be enabled by default for all Education tenants.</li>\n    <li>The app will be available for download via the Microsoft Store: <a href=\"https://aka.ms/getlz\" target=\"_blank\">Microsoft Learning Zone app</a>.&nbsp;</li>\n    <li>Lesson generation is only available for Educators that have M365 users in an <b>Education Tenant</b> and while using a <b>Copilot+ PC device</b>.</li><li>Educators can create, preview, assign, and share AI-generated lessons.</li>\n    <li>IT administrators can opt out of the default enablement at any time via the <font color=\"#000000\" style=\"\"><a href=\"https://aka.ms/LearningZoneAdmin\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"\">Microsoft Learning Zone</a>.</font></li>\n  </ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><b><b>What you can do to prepare:</b></b></p>\n<ul>\n<li>No action is required unless you wish to opt out.</li>\n<li>Optional steps:\n  <ul>\n    <li>Review your tenant’s opt-in/opt-out status.</li>\n    <li>Share internal guidance with educators on how to access and use the app.</li>\n    <li>Update helpdesk documentation to reflect the default enablement.</li>\n    <li>Visit the deployment guide: <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/education/guide/1-reference/baseline-reference-deploy-learning-zone\" target=\"_blank\"><font color=\"#000000\" style=\"\">Deploy Microsoft Learning Zone - M365 Education | Microsoft Learn</font></a>.</li>\n  </ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><b><b>Compliance considerations:</b></b></p>\n<table border=\"1\">\n<tbody><tr><th>Compliance Area</th><th>Explanation</th></tr>\n<tr><td>AI/ML capabilities interacting with customer data</td><td>Microsoft Learning Zone uses AI to generate lesson content based on educator input.</td></tr>\n<tr><td>New generative AI interaction for end users</td><td>Educators interact with generative AI to create and customize lessons.</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Admin control available</td><td>Admins can opt out via the Microsoft Learning Zone.</td></tr>\n<tr><td>User ability to enable/disable</td><td>Educators can choose whether to use the app once available.</td></tr>\n</tbody></table>",
