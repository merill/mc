DVR functionality in the town hall enables event attendees to pause and move forward or back in a town hall, navigate to any previously streamed timestamp, and other abilities that make it more convenient and easier for users to interact with a town hall and digest the content being presented.\n</p><p>To get started, attendees will touch the screen over the content being presented in the town hall and the DVR controls will appear. In this image, the live town hall is on the left, and the DVR view is on the right:\n</p><p><img src=\"https://cxcs.microsoft.net/file/ccp/en-us/c52bbf4c-123a-4f43-9f03-244a77928587\" style=\"width: 400px;\" alt=\"user controls\"></p><p>The user can pause, play, skip 10 seconds forward or backward. The user can also control the volume of the content using volume control. The user can also jump to any point of time in the past from the start of an event. The user can catch up with the content and join the live event by selecting the <i>Watch live</i> button. The town hall window will remain open for 24 hours after the end of the event.</p><p>We are committed to continuously improving the Microsoft Teams experience and are excited to bring this new capability to our customers.\n</p><p>This feature will be available by default.</p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b></p><p>This rollout will happen automatically by the specified dates with no admin action required before the rollout.
