    "Content": "<p><b>Introduction</b></p><p>To maintain uninterrupted access to Microsoft Whiteboard, organizations using explicit domain whitelisting <b>must update</b> their firewall configurations. This change supports backend service operations as part of Microsoftâ€™s One Consolidated Domain Initiative (OCDI).</p><p><b>When this will happen</b></p><p>This change is effective immediately. We recommend updating your firewall rules as soon as possible to avoid service disruptions.</p><p><b>How this affects your organization</b></p><p>Microsoft Whiteboard has transitioned to the <code>cloud.microsoft </code>domain under OCDI. While many tenants have already whitelisted <code>*.cloud.microsoft</code>, some organizations using explicit domain whitelisting have only added <code>whiteboard.cloud.microsoft</code>.</p><p>To ensure full functionality, including backend service operations, the following domain must also be whitelisted:</p><ul><li><code>whiteboard.svc.cloud.microsoft</code></li></ul><p>Failure to include this domain may result in issues with Whiteboard loading or sharing features. This has been confirmed in multiple support cases where backend calls were blocked by firewall rules.</p><p><b>What you can do to prepare</b></p><p>If your organization uses explicit domain whitelisting, please ensure the following domains are allowed:</p><ul><li><code>whiteboard.cloud.microsoft</code></li><li><code>whiteboard.svc.cloud.microsoft</code></li></ul><p>Learn more:&nbsp;</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/enterprise/urls-and-ip-address-ranges?view=o365-worldwide\" target=\"_blank\">Microsoft 365 URLs and IP address ranges | Microsoft 365 for enterprise | Microsoft Learn</a><br></li><li><a href=\"https://mc.merill.net/message/MC1084637\" target=\"_blank\">MC1084637 - Product transitions to the cloud.microsoft domain</a><br></li></ul><p>No action is required for tenants who have already whitelisted <code>*.cloud.microsoft</code>.</p><p><b>Compliance Considerations</b></p><p>No compliance considerations identified, review as appropriate for your organization.</p>",
