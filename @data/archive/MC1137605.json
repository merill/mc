    "Content": "<p><b>Introduction</b></p><p>We’re updating Copilot Analytics reports to include usage of Copilot Chat in Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and OneNote. This means that as users begin using Copilot Chat in these apps, their activity will automatically be reflected in the Microsoft 365 admin center and Viva Insights reports. This change helps provide a more complete and accurate view of Copilot Chat adoption across your organization.\n</p><p><b>When this will happen</b></p><p>The reports will be updated automatically as the Copilot Chat experience becomes available in Microsoft 365 apps for your organization.\n</p><p><b>How this affects your organization</b></p><p>As Copilot Chat becomes available in Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and OneNote, the following analytics reports will be updated:\n</p><ul><li><b>Microsoft 365 admin center – Copilot Chat usage report (unlicensed users):</b> This report will now include usage from Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and OneNote. The all-up Copilot Chat user count and “last activity date” will reflect usage across all supported apps. A future update (Roadmap ID: <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?filters=&amp;searchterms=495549\" target=\"_blank\">495549</a>) will introduce app-specific usage metrics.</li><li><b>Microsoft 365 admin center – Microsoft 365 Copilot usage report (licensed users):&nbsp;</b>This report will be updated to include Copilot Chat usage in the new apps. Metrics such as user counts and “last activity date” for Word, Excel, PowerPoint, OneNote, Copilot Chat (work), and Copilot Chat (web) will be updated accordingly. Users will not be double-counted if they use both the in-app and new Copilot Chat experiences.</li><li><b>Microsoft 365 admin center – AI adoption score (licensed users): </b>Your AI adoption score and peer benchmarks will reflect usage in the new apps. However, feature-level metrics will continue to track only app-specific skills outside of Copilot Chat (e.g., “Summarize document in Word” will not reflect Copilot Chat usage).</li><li><b>Viva Insights – Copilot Dashboard and Advanced Analytics (licensed users):</b> These reports will be updated to include usage in the new apps. Feature-level metrics may temporarily decline as they currently exclude Copilot Chat activity.
