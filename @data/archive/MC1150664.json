Since <b>Basic Mobility and Security for Microsoft 365</b>&nbsp;uses Intune infrastructure, customers may need to add Azure Front Door IP addresses, if using a firewall allowlist that allows outbound traffic based on IP addresses or Azure service tags.</p><p>Do not remove any existing network endpoints required for Basic Mobility and Security for Microsoft 365. Additional network endpoints are documented as part of the Azure Front Door and service tags information referenced in the files linked below:</p><ul><li>Public clouds: <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=56519\" target=\"_blank\">Download Azure IP Ranges and Service Tags – Public Cloud from Official Microsoft Download Center</a>&nbsp;</li><li>Government clouds: <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=57063\" target=\"_blank\">Download Azure IP Ranges and Service Tags – US Government Cloud from Official Microsoft Download Center</a>&nbsp;</li></ul><p>The additional ranges are those listed in the JSON files linked above and can be found by searching for “AzureFrontDoor.MicrosoftSecurity”.</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b>\n</p><p>If you have configured an outbound traffic policy for IP address ranges or Azure service tags for your firewalls, routers, proxy servers, client-based firewalls, VPN or network security groups, you will need to update them to include the new Azure Front Door ranges with the “AzureFrontDoor.MicrosoftSecurity” tag.&nbsp;</p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b>\n</p><p>Ensure that your firewall rules are updated and added to your firewall’s allowlist with the additional IP addresses documented under Azure Front Door by <b>December 2, 2025</b>.&nbsp;</p><p>Alternatively, you may add the service tag “AzureFrontDoor.MicrosoftSecurity” to your firewall rules to allow outbound traffic on port 443 for the addresses in the tag.&nbsp;</p><p>If you are not the IT admin who can make this change, notify your networking team. If you are responsible for configuring internet traffic, refer to the following documentation for more details:</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/frontdoor/origin-security?tabs=app-service-functions&amp;pivots=front-door-classic\" target=\"_blank\">Azure Front Door</a></li><li><a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-network/service-tags-overview\" target=\"_blank\">Azure service tags</a></li></ul><p>If you have a helpdesk, inform them about this upcoming change.
