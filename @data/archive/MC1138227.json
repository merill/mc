This feature will reach general availability on September 1, 2025.<br><br> \n<b>How does this affect me? </b><br>\nThis feature enables you to set up a relationship between two lookup fields in the Customer Insights - Journeys form editor. After you select the relationship, a selection in one field will filter the values in the other field. Field filtering dynamically filters values of subsequent lookup field values based on the values selected in previous fields, so users see only relevant choices.<br><br>\n<b>What action do I need to take? </b><br>\nThis message is for awareness, and no action is required.",
