    "Content": "<p>Updated August 28, 2025: We have updated the timeline. Thank you for your patience.\n</p><p><b>Introduction</b></p><p>Microsoft 365 Copilot in PowerPoint will soon support the use of your organization’s branded images when creating slides. By integrating enterprise assets stored in SharePoint Organization Asset Libraries (OAL) or Templafy (third-party solution), users can generate slides that use your brand images.</p><p>This message is associated with Microsoft 365 Roadmap IDs&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?filters=&amp;searchterms=496365\" target=\"_blank\">496365</a>, <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?id=496366\" target=\"_blank\">496366</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?filters=&amp;searchterms=496367\" target=\"_blank\">496367</a>.</p><p>\n</p><p><b>When this will happen</b></p><p><b>General Availability (Worldwide): </b>We will begin rolling out in early September 2025 (previously late August) and expect to complete by late October 2025 (previously late September).\n</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization</b></p><p>After this rollout, brand managers and admins can connect enterprise image libraries from either SharePoint Organization Asset Libraries (OAL) or Templafy to Microsoft 365 Copilot in PowerPoint. Once connected, users will be able to generate slides using branded images from your organization’s asset library, helping ensure brand consistency.</p><p>This feature will be available by default for admins to configure. If no enterprise image library is connected, the option to use branded images will be disabled in the image source menu, and only Microsoft 365 images will be available.</p><p><b>Sharepoint OAL setup</b></p><p>To enable this feature with SharePoint OAL, admins must:\n</p><ul><li>Create an organization asset library in SharePoint for your company’s brand images.\n</li><li>Run a Microsoft PowerShell command to connect the image library to Microsoft 365 Copilot.\n</li><li>Ensure that images include robust metadata (keywords, titles, and alt-text) to support searchability.</li></ul><p><b>Templafy setup</b></p><p>To enable this feature with Templafy, admins must:\n</p><ul><li>Have an active Templafy account configured with your company’s brand assets.\n</li><li>Enable the Microsoft Graph Connector in your Templafy account settings to establish the Copilot connection.\n</li><li>Ensure that images include robust metadata (keywords, titles, and alt-text) to support searchability.\n</li></ul><p>Once setup is complete, users can select the <b>New Slide Copilot </b>icon in the PowerPoint ribbon, enter a prompt, and choose their preferred image source—either Microsoft 365 images or their organization’s branded image library—via the <b>Image Source</b> menu.</p><p>Admins can email <b>pptentimg_admin@microsoft.com</b> to request connection of their enterprise assets to Copilot in PowerPoint.</p><p><b>Note:</b> We recommend enabling this feature only if your image library contains more than 1,000 images with robust metadata.</p><p><i>After setup, the option to select branded images from your organization’s library will be enabled when generating slides with Copilot in PowerPoint:</i><i>&nbsp;</i><img src=\"https://cxcs.microsoft.net/static/public/messagecenter/neutral/195faa33-9c46-410a-bfc6-393352b66e85/d31f900110e856899061e91fc31b46377dfcbe24.png\" alt=\"user settings\" style=\"width: 500px;\"></p><p></p><p><i>Copilot in PowerPoint allows users to enter a prompt and choose image sources, including your organization’s branded image library, if connected.:&nbsp;</i><img src=\"https://cxcs.microsoft.net/static/public/messagecenter/neutral/848e711e-6c2d-4cd2-b543-d93c710735c9/ea7cf97b017f9729f3b02510c3e97cab8e7cd62d.png\" style=\"width: 500px;\" alt=\"user settings\"></p><p></p><p><b>What you can do to prepare:\n</b></p><p>Admins should:\n</p><ul><li>Notify brand managers of this new capability.\n</li><li>Decide if you'd like to connect SharePoint OAL or Templafy to Copilot. Email pptentimg_admin@microsoft.com to connect enterprise assets.</li><li>If enabled, inform employees that Copilot in PowerPoint can now use organizational images when generating slides.\n</li></ul><p>Learn more:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://support.microsoft.com/topic/keep-your-presentation-on-brand-with-copilot-046c23d5-012e-49e0-8579-fe49302959fc\" target=\"_blank\">Keep your presentation on-brand with Copilot | Copilot in PowerPoint</a></p><p><b>Compliance considerations:\n</b></p><p>Does the change alter how existing customer data is processed, stored, or accessed? - Maybe. If the image libraries contain sensitive or regulated content, enabling Copilot to access and use them could change how that data is accessed and surfaced.\n</p><p>Does the change introduce or significantly modify AI/ML or agent capabilities that interact with or provide access to customer data? - Yes. This feature expands Copilot’s generative AI capabilities by integrating branded image libraries into slide generation.\n</p><p>Does the change provide users any new way of interacting with generative AI? - Yes. Users will be able to generate slides with Copilot that automatically incorporate organizational images, which is a new interaction model.</p>",
