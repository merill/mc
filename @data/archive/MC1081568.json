    "Content": "<p>Updated October 24, 2025: We have updated the content. Thank you for your patience.</p><p>Coming soon to Microsoft Teams: When users connect to their organization's Wi-Fi, Teams can automatically set their work location to reflect the building they are working in. This makes it easier for users to coordinate work with their coworkers and connect in person.</p><p> This feature is opt-in and requires you to take action to configure it. After you turn it on, end-users remain in control and can choose whether to share their work location with their coworkers.</p><p>This message applies to Teams for Windows desktop and Teams for Mac desktop.</p><p>This message is associated with Microsoft 365 Roadmap ID <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?filters=&amp;searchterms=488800\" target=\"_blank\">488800</a>.\n</p><p><b>When this will happen:</b>\n</p><p>General Availability (Worldwide): We will begin rolling in December 2025.</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b>\n</p><p>This feature allows you to map Wi-Fi networks and devices to buildings, which allows your users to have their work location automatically updated when they connect. This is a major improvement over the current experience which relies on end-users to manually set their work location. When this feature is configured and enabled, Teams can automatically update the work location of users who connect their laptop to your organization's Wi-Fi network or peripherals. The feature can leverage the mapping between your building names and your Wi-Fi networks to set the work location of your users to the right building. It can also leverage mappings to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/rooms/bookable-desks\" target=\"_blank\">specific peripherals</a>, such as monitors. Teams uses the same policy to enable or disable automatic updates of work location for Wi-Fi and peripherals. Learn more: <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/module/teams/new-csteamsworklocationdetectionpolicy\" target=\"_blank\">New-CsTeamsWorkLocationDetectionPolicy (MicrosoftTeamsPowerShell) | Microsoft Learn</a></p><p>Teams will not update the location of your users if they connect after their working hours (that they can configure in the Microsoft Outlook Calendar). Also, their work location will be cleared at the end of their working hours.</p><p>\n</p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b></p><p>Automatic update of work location is off by default, but it can greatly improve the experience of your users. We recommend turning it on and configuring it in your tenant.\n</p><p>Before rollout, we will update this post with new documentation.</p>",
