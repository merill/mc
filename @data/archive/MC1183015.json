    "Content": "<p>Updated November 19, 2025: We have updated the timing of this change below. Thank you for your patience.</p><p>On July 1, 2026, you may encounter issues if you haven't updated your analytic rules, automation rules/playbooks, workbooks, hunting queries, or custom integrations to be precedence-aware for account entity naming. We've standardized the account entity naming logic in Microsoft Sentinel incidents and alerts, where the account entity naming priority is: UPN prefix → name → display name. Please update your queries and automations to use the new precedence pattern.</p><p>You are receiving this message because our reporting indicates your organization may be using Microsoft Sentinel incidents, alerts (AlertV3), or related automation.</p><p><b><b>When this will happen:</b></b></p><p>July 1, 2026 (previously February 13, 2026)</p><p><b><b>How this will affect your organization:</b>\n</b></p><p><b>If you don't fix this problem, these queries, automations, dashboards, and reports that reference account names may be affected:\n</b></p><ul><li>Analytics (KQL) that filter by, join on, or normalize account names\n</li><li>Automation rules &amp; playbooks (e.g., Logic Apps) that map Account.Name or compare it to other identity fields\n</li><li>Workbooks &amp; dashboards that show account name or aggregate by that value\n</li><li>Hunting queries that coalesce or parse account identity fields\n</li><li>Any users or systems relying on display name as the account identifier</li></ul><p><b><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b>\n</b></p><p>To fix this problem you need to update your KQL queries and automation logic to use the new precedence-aware pattern for account entity naming. Specifically, use a coalesce pattern (e.g., coalesce(Name, DisplayName)) wherever you reference the account name, and validate your workbooks, dashboards, and playbooks against the new logic. Test changes in a nonproduction workspace before rollout.</p>",
