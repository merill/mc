This change enables Microsoft 365 Copilot agents to query other agents for additional data, expanding the scope of AI-driven interactions with customer data.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Does the change allow a user to enable and disable the feature themselves?</td>\n<td>Yes. Users will be able to enable or disable acquired agents per conversation, giving them control over agent behavior.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Does the change include an admin control and can it be controlled through Entra ID group membership?</td>\n<td>Yes. Admins can configure which agents are available and which connected agents are permitted. These controls respect existing agent acquisition permissions, which can be scoped using Entra ID group membership.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table><p></p>",
