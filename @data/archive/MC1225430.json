    "Content": "We are announcing Quality Evaluation Agent evaluation criteria versioning in Dynamics 365 Contact Center. This feature will reach general availability on February 6, 2026.<br><br> \n\n  \n\n<b>How does this affect me?</b><br> \n\nThis feature enables supervisors to update published evaluation criteria that are used to measure quality across customer engagements. Every edit automatically creates a new criteria version, ensuring existing evaluations continue to run uninterrupted using the last known published version.<br><br>  \nAll criteria versions are accessible through the Evaluation Criteria Versioning History tab, providing full visibility into how criteria have evolved over time. Supervisors can review prior versions, restore any version to make it the current one, or discard draft changes as needed.<br><br>  \n \nSupervisors can also run a simulation test to preview outcomes. This allows teams to validate changes, fine‑tune instructions, and verify expected outcomes before publishing updated criteria for live quality evaluations.<br><br> \n  \n\n<b>What action do I need to take?</b><br> \nThis message is for awareness, and no action is required.",
