    "Content": "<p><b>Introduction</b></p><p>We’re excited to announce that Microsoft Teams now supports apps in Shared Channels. This update enables richer collaboration scenarios across teams and organizations by allowing users to add and use apps—including bots, tabs, and message extensions—directly within Shared Channels. This change aligns with customer feedback requesting more consistent and flexible app experiences across collaboration spaces. Support for apps in Private Channels will follow the same model, ensuring a unified experience for users and developers.</p><p>This message is associated with Roadmap ID <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?filters=&amp;searchterms=505791\" target=\"_blank\">505791</a>&nbsp;and applies to Teams for Windows desktop, Teams for Mac desktop, Teams for the web, and Teams for iOS/Android.</p>\n\n<p><b>When this will happen:</b></p>\n<ul>\n<li><b style=\"\">Targeted Release:</b> Rollout begins in mid-October 2025 and is expected to complete in late October 2025</li><li><b style=\"\">General availability (Worldwide):</b> Rollout begins in early&nbsp;November 2025&nbsp;and is expected to&nbsp;complete in late November 2025.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><b>How this affects your organization:</b></p>\n<p><b>Who is affected:</b></p>\n<ul>\n<li>All Microsoft Teams users who participate in Shared Channels</li>\n<li>Admins managing Teams app policies</li>\n<li>Developers maintaining Teams apps</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><b>What’s changing:</b></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Apps can now be added to Shared Channels.
