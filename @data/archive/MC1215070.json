If you have not, please read on.</p><p>As part of our ongoing commitment to advancing cybersecurity across our company and products, last year, starting February 2025, <a href=\"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-365-blog/microsoft-will-require-mfa-to-access-the-microsoft-365-admin/ba-p/4232568\" target=\"_blank\">Microsoft began requiring all users to use multi-factor authentication (MFA)</a> when signing into the <a href=\"https://admin.cloud.microsoft/\" target=\"_blank\">Microsoft 365 admin center</a>. Starting February 9th 2026, Microsoft will continue to ramp up enforcement, and users will be unable to sign in to the Microsoft 365 admin center without successfully completing MFA.\n</p><p>Implementing MFA in the Microsoft 365 admin center significantly reduces the risk of account compromise, prevents unauthorized access, and safeguards sensitive data. By adding an extra layer of protection beyond standard username and password authentication, MFA makes it harder for attackers to steal data and prevents unauthorized access from phishing, credential stuffing, brute force, or password reuse attacks.</p><p><b>Take action now</b></p><p>Global admins: To set up MFA in your organization now, visit the MFA setup guide at <a href=\"https://aka.ms/MFAWizard\" target=\"_blank\">aka.ms/MFAWizard</a> or refer to <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/admin/security-and-compliance/set-up-multi-factor-authentication?view=o365-worldwide\" target=\"_blank\">Set up multifactor authentication for Microsoft 365</a>\n</p><p>Users accessing the Microsoft 365 admin center: Check your verification methods and add one if needed by going to <a href=\"https://aka.ms/mfasetup\" target=\"_blank\">aka.ms/mfasetup</a>.\n</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization\n</b></p><p>MFA will need to be enabled for your tenant to ensure admins are able to sign-in to the Microsoft 365 admin center.

It is recommended that you verify that all users accessing the Microsoft 365 admin center have added a verification method to their account (such as a Microsoft Authenticator).\n</li><li>Global admins: To set up MFA in your organization now, visit the MFA setup guide at <a href=\"https://aka.ms/MFAWizard\" target=\"_blank\">aka.ms/MFAWizard</a> or refer to <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/admin/security-and-compliance/set-up-multi-factor-authentication?view=o365-worldwide\" target=\"_blank\">Set up multifactor authentication for Microsoft 365</a>.\n</li><li>Users accessing the Microsoft 365 admin center: Check your verification methods and add one if needed by going to <a href=\"https://aka.ms/mfasetup\" target=\"_blank\">aka.ms/mfasetup</a>.</li></ul><p>For more information, refer to the FAQs in the blog post <a href=\"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-365-blog/microsoft-will-require-mfa-to-access-the-microsoft-365-admin/ba-p/4232568\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); font-family: sans-serif; font-weight: 400;\">here</a>.</p><p>Additional info URL (i.e., link to relevant support doc):</p><p><a href=\"https://aka.ms/mfasetup\" target=\"_blank\">https://aka.ms/mfasetup</a>\n</p><p><a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/admin/security-and-compliance/multi-factor-authentication-microsoft-365?view=o365-worldwide\" target=\"_blank\">Multifactor authentication for Microsoft 365 - Microsoft 365 admin | Microsoft Learn</a>\n</p><p><a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/admin/security-and-compliance/set-up-multi-factor-authentication?view=o365-worldwide\" target=\"_blank\">Set up multifactor authentication for users - Microsoft 365 admin | Microsoft Learn</a>\n</p>",
