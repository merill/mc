    "Content": "<p>Updated October 17, 2025: We have updated this MC ID. Thank you for your patience.</p><p><b><b>Introduction</b></b>\n</p><p>To enhance transparency and user control, Microsoft Teams is expanding the Explicit Recording Consent feature to include 1:1 Teams calls. This update ensures that participants must provide explicit consent before their media (audio, video, and content sharing) is included in any recording or transcription initiated by another user. This change supports privacy compliance and aligns with customer feedback requesting more granular consent controls.</p><p>This message is associated with Roadmap ID&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/roadmap?filters=&amp;searchterms=503295\" target=\"_blank\">503295</a>.</p>\n\n<b><b>When this will happen:</b></b>\n<ul>\n<li>Targeted Release: Begins early December 2025, completes mid-December 2025.\n</li><li>General Availability (Worldwide, GCC): Begins mid-December 2025, completes mid-January 2026.\n</li><li>General Availability (GCC High): Begins mid-January 2026, completes late January 2026.\n</li><li>General Availability (DoD): Begins late January 2026, completes early February 2026.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<b><b>How this affects your organization:</b></b>\n<p><b>Who is affected:</b></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Microsoft Teams administrators managing calling policies.</li>\n<li>Users participating in 1:1 Teams VoIP calls where recording or transcription is initiated.</li><li>Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) endpoints will be auto consented.
