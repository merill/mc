Thank you for your patience.</p><p>Coming soon in Microsoft Teams: An enhanced content consumption experience in Teams chats and channels. We are about to release a series of features that will help you to identify, consume, and act on content such as files, lists, and SharePoint pages/posts. In this first release in the series, we will roll out file image previews in chats and channels, to help users better identify a file in the conversation stream. When a file (such as a JPG or PNG image file, a Microsoft PowerPoint file, or a PDF) is attached to a message in chat or a channel, users will see a small image of the file without opening the file.</p><p>This message is associated with Microsoft 365 Roadmap ID&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/roadmap?filters=&amp;searchterms=395936\" target=\"_blank\">395936&nbsp;</a></p><p>\n</p><p><b>When this will happen:</b>\n</p><p>Targeted Release: We will begin rolling out early June 2024 and expect to complete by early June 2024.\n</p><p>General Availability (Worldwide): We will begin rolling out mid-June 2024 and expect to complete by late June 2024.\n</p><p>General Availability (GCC): We will begin rolling out late June 2024 and expect to complete by early July 2024.\n</p><p>General Availability (GCC High): We will begin rolling out early July 2024 and expect to complete by late July 2024.\n</p><p>General Availability (DoD): We will begin rolling out late July 2024 and expect to complete by early August 2024 (previously late July).\n</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b>\n</p><p><i>Image preview benefits</i>\n</p><ul><li>Quickly scan for and find the file you need\n</li><li>Preview part of the file content before opening it\n</li><li>Save time and bandwidth by avoiding unnecessary file downloads and file opens\n</li></ul><p>To use the new file image previews, users will upload or share a file in a chat or a channel, and then see an image preview of the file content (and its metadata) in the message.
