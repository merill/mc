Based on feedback for more dynamic and immersive audio experiences, <b>Microsoft is introducing real-time voice interactions</b> in<i> Podcast</i>. The new interactive podcast feature transforms this into a dynamic, conversational experience, where users can join the hosts’ discussion of their document, ask questions in real time, and uncover insights naturally — staying immersed while gaining understanding faster.</p>\n\n<p>This message is associated with Microsoft 365 Roadmap ID <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?filters=&amp;searchterms=523206\" target=\"_blank\">523206</a>.</p><p><b><b>When this will happen:</b></b>\n</p><p>General Availability (Worldwide): Rollout will begin in late November 2025 and is expected to complete by late December 2025.</p>\n\n<p><b><b>How this affects your organization:</b></b></p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Who is affected:</b> Customers with Copilot licenses who generate audio overviews.</li>\n<li><b>What will happen:</b>\n  <ul>\n    <li>Users will be able to join podcast conversations and ask questions in real time.</li>\n    <li>The feature enhances document-based podcasts with interactive voice capabilities.</li>\n    <li>The feature will be ON by default for eligible users.</li>\n    <li>No changes to existing admin policies are required.</li>\n  </ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><b><b>What you can do to prepare:</b></b></p>\n<ul>\n<li>No admin action is required.</li>\n<li>Communicate this change to helpdesk staff.</li>\n<li>Update internal documentation if you reference podcast or audio overview features.</li>\n<li>For more information, refer to upcoming documentation in the <i>Microsoft Learn portal</i>.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><b><b>Compliance considerations:</b></b>\n</p><p>No compliance considerations identified, review as appropriate for your organization.</p>",
