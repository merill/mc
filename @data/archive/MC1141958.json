    "Content": "<p>As a follow up to MC804771, based on Admin feedback, we are updating the behavior for automated hiding of inactive channels to be opt-in (suggestions) only. With this update, Teams will offer users suggestions on channels that are inactive, and the user is prompted to review their inactive channels and hide them only if they choose. The user will also be able to view when they last visited the channel to help them decide if they would like to hide the channel. The settings support this opt-in workflow and there are no changes to the on demand hiding process.\n</p><p>This message is associated with Microsoft 365 Roadmap ID: <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?rtc=1%26filters%3D&amp;searchterms=325780\" target=\"_blank\">325780</a></p><p>\n</p><p><b><b>When this will happen:</b>\n</b></p><p>Targeted Release: Available now.</p><p>General Availability (Worldwide, GCC, GCC High, DoD): We will begin rolling out in late August 2025.</p><p>\n</p><p><b><b>How this will affect your organization:</b>\n</b></p><p><b>Before this rollout:</b></p><p>Users had to manually manage their relevant channels list by hiding inactive and irrelevant channels.\n</p><p><b>After this rollout: \n</b></p><p>Manage preferences for automated suggestions via Teams Settings\n</p><p>If users prefer to manage channels manually, they can opt out of the auto-suggestions process. Simply go to Teams settings, select General, and toggle off \"Suggestions for hiding inactive channels.\" \n</p><p>Hide inactive channels on demand when needed\n</p><p>Users can manually view which channels are inactive and choose to hide some or all of them whenever you need. This can be done from Settings, under General, by clicking the \"Get Suggestions\" button. Note that this action can be performed once every 24 hours.</p><p>\n</p><p><img src=\"https://cxcs.microsoft.net/file/ccp/en-us/d494c053-239e-476e-a16d-039d28cfde29 \" width=\"400\" height=\"\"></p><p><b>Automated suggestions of inactive channels \n</b></p><p>With this, Teams will suggest channels that have been inactive for the user. Once the inactive channels are identified, the user is notified with the coach mark message, \"Looks like you havenâ€™t visited some channels lately.
