    "Content": "<p>As mentioned in MC1097219, later this year, we expect macOS Tahoe 26 to be released by Apple. Microsoft Intune, the Company Portal app and the Intune MDM agent will be moving to support macOS 14 (Sonoma) and later. Since the Company Portal app for iOS and macOS are a unified app, this change will occur shortly after the release of macOS 26. This does not affect existing enrolled devices.</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b>\n</p><p>This will only affect you if you currently manage, or plan to manage macOS devices with Intune. This may not impact you because your users have likely already upgraded their macOS devices. Refer to <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/105113\" target=\"_blank\">macOS Sonoma is compatible with these computers â€“ Apple Support</a> for a list of devices that are supported.</p><p><b>Note:</b> Devices that are currently enrolled on macOS 13.x or below will continue to remain enrolled even when those versions are no longer supported. New devices will be unable to enroll if they are running macOS 13.x or below.</p><p>Enrolled macOS devices without user affinity, either through Automated Device Enrollment (ADE) without user affinity or Direct Enrollment, have a slightly nuanced support statement due to their shared usage. For more details, see <a href=\"https://aka.ms/Intune/macOS/ADE-DE-support\" target=\"_blank\">https://aka.ms/Intune/macOS/ADE-DE-support</a>.</p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b>\n</p><p>Check your Intune reporting to see which devices or users may be affected. Go to <b>Devices </b>&gt; <b>All devices</b> and filter by macOS. You can add in additional columns to help identify who in your organization has devices running macOS 13.x or below. Request that your users upgrade their devices to a supported OS version before this change.&nbsp;</p>",
