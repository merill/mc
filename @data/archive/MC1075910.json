Thank you for your patience.\n</p><p>Users have long been able to use personal Microsoft accounts with the OneDrive app on corporate Windows devices—unless restricted by admin policy. This new feature introduces a prompt only when a personal account is already signed in on the device, encouraging users to also sign in to the OneDrive app with that account.</p><p><img src=\"https://cxcs.microsoft.net/static/public/messagecenter/neutral/e1f16d1f-e7ef-4d35-896d-183bffaa1015/032e219799e6662eff1cd20b1c150acb98cb5818.png\" style=\"width: 600px;\"><br></p><p>This message is associated with Microsoft 365 Roadmap ID<a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?rtc=1%26filters%3D&amp;searchterms=490064\" target=\"_blank\"> 490064.</a></p><p><b>When this will happen</b></p><p>General Availability (Worldwide): We will begin rolling out in mid-July 2025 (previously mid-June) and expect to complete by early September 2025 (previously early August).</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization</b></p><p>This new feature introduces a prompt only when a personal account is already signed in on the device, encouraging users to also sign in to the OneDrive app with that account. This update does not “sync” personal files with corporate accounts or vice versa. It simply allows access to separate OneDrive accounts on the same device without merging content – similar to checking both work and personal emails on one device without combining inboxes. Administrators who have already restricted personal accounts on corporate devices can continue to manage this as before.\n</p><p>Importantly, this prompt does not combine or transfer files between personal and corporate accounts. Users must take deliberate action to move or save files between accounts, and Microsoft blocks the move of known folders to personal OneDrive accounts from domain joined devices by default. Additionally, data protection features such as sensitivity labels and data loss prevention (DLP) policies continue to apply.\n</p><p>Devices in regions where the Digital Markets Act is applicable will not see this prompt.\n</p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare</b></p><p>If you don’t want the message prompting users to sign into the OneDrive app with a personal account, you can use policies to disable the prompt.\n</p><p>Organizations that have already disabled personal OneDrive accounts on corporate devices with the <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepoint/use-group-policy#prevent-users-from-syncing-personal-onedrive-accounts\" target=\"_blank\">DisablePersonalSync</a> policy will not see this prompt. Administrators can also suppress it using the <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepoint/use-group-policy#hide-the-messages-to-sync-consumer-onedrive-files\" target=\"_blank\">DisableNewAccountDetection</a> policy.
