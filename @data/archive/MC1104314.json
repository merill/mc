    "Content": "<p>Updated August 11, 2025: We have updated the timeline. Thank you for your patience.</p><p>We're introducing a new delegation capability in Microsoft Viva Pulse to support executive assistants, chiefs of staff, and other designated roles who act on behalf of organizational leaders. Starting mid-August 2025 (previously mid-July), users will be able to assign delegates to manage the Pulse survey lifecycle on their behalf—helping streamline feedback collection and analysis.</p><p>This message is associated with Microsoft 365 Roadmap ID <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?rtc=1%26filters%3D&amp;searchterms=479753\" target=\"_blank\">479753</a></p><p>\n</p><p><b>When this will happen:</b>\n</p><p>General Availability (Worldwide): Rollout begins mid-August 2025 (previously mid-July).\n</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b>\n</p><p>Delegation will be enabled by default. This feature allows a user (the delegator) to authorize another user (the delegate) to create, send, and manage Pulse surveys. Delegators retain full visibility and ownership of all activity.\n</p><p>Admins can manage delegation settings at the tenant, group (via Microsoft Entra ID or Microsoft 365 groups), or individual user level using centralized feature access management.\n</p><p>Delegates will be able to:\n</p><ul><li>Create and send Pulses on behalf of the delegator. Recipients will see that the Pulse was sent on their behalf.\n</li><li>View all Pulses (sent or drafted) and Pulse reports.\n</li></ul><p>Delegates will not be able to:\n</p><ul><li>View or respond to confidential conversations.\n</li><li>Share Pulse reports.\n</li></ul><p><b>What you can do to prepare:</b>\n</p><p>No admin action is required before rollout. However, we recommend:\n</p><ul><li>Reviewing your current configuration to assess impact.\n</li><li>Notifying users and updating internal documentation.\n</li><li>Managing delegation policies in the Microsoft 365 admin center or via PowerShell using the <code>FeatureID</code> value <code>PulseDelegation</code>.\n</li></ul><p>Learn more:\n</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/viva/feature-access-management\" target=\"_blank\">Microsoft Viva - Feature access management | Microsoft Learn</a></li><li><a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/Viva/control-access-admin-center\" target=\"_blank\">Control who can access features in Microsoft 365 using the Microsoft 365 admin center</a>&nbsp;</li><li><a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/Viva/manage-access-policies\" target=\"_blank\">Control access to features in Microsoft 365 using PowerShell</a></li></ul><p>We’ll update this post with setup documentation before rollout completes.</p><p><b>Compliance considerations:</b></p><ul><li>Changes to data processing/storage/access: Yes - Delegates gain access to Pulse survey content and reports on behalf of the delegator.</li></ul>",
