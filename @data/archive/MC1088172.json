    "Content": "<p>Updated July 29, 2025: We have updated the content. Thank you for your patience.</p><p>Coming soon to Microsoft Teams channels: A new threaded layout similar to group chats. Before this rollout, channels have a <i>Post reply </i>layout option only. </p><p>After this rollout, the threaded layout will encourage immediate back-and-forth communication in channels. In threaded layout channels, users can reply to specific messages and start a thread in the side pane. Threads allow users to have side conversations while keeping the main conversation without cluttering the main conversation.</p><p>This message applies to Teams for Windows desktop, Teams for Mac desktop, Teams for the web, and Teams for iOS/Android.</p><p>This message is associated with Microsoft 365 Roadmap ID <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?filters=&amp;searchterms=488300\" target=\"_blank\">488300</a>.</p><p>\n</p><p><b>When this will happen:</b>\n</p><p>Targeted Release: We will begin rolling out late June 2025 and expect to complete by early July 2025.</p><p>General Availability (Worldwide): We will begin rolling out mid-August 2025 and expect to complete by late August 2025.</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b></p><p>After this rollout, to use threaded channels, users can either create a new channel and select <i>Layout &gt; Threads,</i> or channel owners can use<i> Edit channel</i> to convert an existing posts channel to a threads layout.\n</p><p><img src=\"https://cxcs.microsoft.net/file/ccp/en-us/01e0fd3a-ddc6-4db3-b411-100f86febf85\" style=\"width: 400px;\" alt=\"user settings\">\n</p><p>Benefits of threaded layout channels:</p><ul><li>Provide a more collaborative layout for conversation in channels (no need to create a post to start a conversation)\n</li><li>Provide a way for users to have deeper conversations on sub-topics\n</li><li>Users can discuss multiple topics without disrupting the main conversation\n</li></ul><p>Users can select <i>Reply in thread </i>to open the side pane and compose a message to start a thread on a sub-topic. \n</p><p><img src=\"https://cxcs.microsoft.net/file/ccp/en-us/bf35c0a7-5e63-4e3a-bcef-9fe0edb33213\" style=\"width: 400px;\" alt=\"user settings\">\n</p><p>The <i>Followed threads</i> quick view shows users all the threads they're following across all channels in one place:\n</p><p><img src=\"https://cxcs.microsoft.net/file/ccp/en-us/30574002-345d-4411-9ceb-6af5eb921c42\" style=\"width: 400px;\" alt=\"user settings\"></p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b></p><p>This rollout will happen automatically by the specified dates with no admin action required before the rollout. Review your current configuration to assess the impact on your organization. You may want to notify your users about this change and update your relevant documentation. </p><p>This will be a ring-based rollout. If users in the same channel are in different rings, then users who don’t yet have Threads layout will see the channel in a Backwards compatibility mode. The channel will appear as a Posts layout channel for them, with a banner at the top notifying them that others have the Threads layout feature and are seeing the channel in a different view.</p><p>Before rollout, we will update this post with new documentation.</p><p>Additional Resources:</p><p>Overall site: <a href=\"https://adoption.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-teams/new-chat-and-channels-experience/\" target=\"_blank\">The new Microsoft Teams chat and channels experience – Microsoft Adoption&nbsp;</a></p><p>About threads layout: <a href=\"https://adoption.microsoft.com/files/microsoft-teams/Threads-layout-in-Microsoft-Teams-channels.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Threads-layout-in-Microsoft-Teams-channels.pdf&nbsp;</a></p><p>Best practices: <a href=\"https://adoption.microsoft.com/files/microsoft-teams/Threads-layout-in-Microsoft-Teams-channels_FAQ.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Threads-layout-in-Microsoft-Teams-channels_FAQ.pdf</a></p><p>Backwards compatibility guide: <a href=\"https://adoption.microsoft.com/files/microsoft-teams/Threads-layout-in-Microsoft-Teams-channels_Backwards-compatability-guide.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Threads-layout-in-Microsoft-Teams-channels_Backwards-compatability-guide.pdf&nbsp;</a></p>",
