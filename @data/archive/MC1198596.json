Additionally, this feature provides supervisors with full control over score calculations, allowing either weighted criteria or equal distribution.<ul><li><b>Evaluation criteria</b>: Supervisors create a form with questions, answer choices, scoring metrics, and instructions for Quality Evaluation Automation.
