    "Content": "<p><b><b>Introduction</b></b></p><p>\nOutlook’s <i><b>Events from email</b></i> feature helps users stay organized by automatically adding reservations such as flights, hotels, rental cars, and deliveries to their calendars.&nbsp;&nbsp;To improve reliability and ensure this feature continues to work smoothly, we <b>strongly </b>encourage all providers to adopt <a href=\"http://Schema.org\" target=\"_blank\">Schema.org</a> markup in their transactional emails.&nbsp;This change aligns with industry standards and improves accuracy, consistency, and long-term support.</p>Until now, Outlook has relied on legacy extraction to support this feature. However:\n<p></p><ul><li>Legacy extraction is fragile, and once templates fail, they cannot be fixed.\n</li><li>We are receiving increasing reports of incorrect or missing events.\n</li><li>It is technically impossible to make further improvements to the old stack.</li><li>By January 2026, the old extraction stack will no longer be supported.</li></ul><p>Screenshot of <i>Settings &gt; Calendar &gt; Events from email</i></p><img src=\"https://cxcs.microsoft.net/file/ccp/en-us/b72fb624-62cf-417e-a54e-037246e48c1a\" style=\"width: 400px;\" alt=\"user settings\"><p></p><p></p>\n\n<p><b><b>When this will happen:</b></b></p><p>\nLegacy extraction will be retired on&nbsp;<b>January 31, 2026</b>. After this date, only emails using <a href=\"http://Schema.org\" target=\"_blank\">Schema.org</a> markup will be supported for automatic event extraction.</p>\n\n<p><b><b>How this affects your organization:</b></b></p>\n<p><b>Who is affected:</b></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Organizations whose users rely on Outlook’s <i>Events from email</i> feature.</li>\n<li>Partners and providers who send transactional emails (e.g., airlines, hotels, travel agencies, delivery services).</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><b>What will happen:</b></p><ul>\n<li>Emails that rely on legacy extraction will stop generating events after January 2026.</li><li>Emails using Schema.org markup will continue to generate calendar events automatically.</li>\n<li>Partners using Schema.org markup report up to 30% higher engagement and more reliable event extraction.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><b><b>What you can do to prepare:</b></b></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Identify providers (e.g., airlines, hotels, travel agencies, and delivery partners) that send confirmation emails to your users.</li>\n<li>Work with those providers to adopt Schema.org markup for supported scenarios.</li>\n<li><span style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\">If you’d like assistance onboarding a provider to schema.org, please reach out to&nbsp;<a href=\"mailto://txppro@microsoft.com\" target=\"_blank\">txppro@microsoft.com</a> along with your provider details.&nbsp;</span></li><li>Communicate this change to helpdesk staff.</li></ul>\n\n<p><b><b>Compliance considerations</b> </b></p>\nNo compliance considerations identified, review as appropriate for your organization.<p></p>",
