    "Content": "<p>Updated December 8, 2025: We have updated the content and timeline. Thank you for your patience.&nbsp;</p><p><b><b>Introduction</b></b></p><p>\nOutlook’s <i><b>Events from email</b></i> feature helps users stay organized by automatically adding reservations such as flights, hotels, rental cars, and deliveries to their calendars.&nbsp;&nbsp;To improve reliability and ensure this feature continues to work smoothly, we <b>strongly </b>encourage all providers to adopt <a href=\"http://Schema.org\" target=\"_blank\">Schema.org</a> markup in their transactional emails.&nbsp;This change aligns with industry standards and improves accuracy, consistency, and long-term support.</p>Until now, Outlook has relied on legacy extraction to support this feature. However:\n<p></p><ul><li>Legacy extraction is fragile, and once templates fail, they cannot be fixed.\n</li><li>We are receiving increasing reports of incorrect or missing events.\n</li><li>It is technically impossible to make further improvements to the old stack.</li><li>Without migration to <a href=\"http://Schema.org\">Schema.org</a>, the quality and reliability of event extraction will continue to degrade over time.</li></ul><p>Screenshot of <i>Settings &gt; Calendar &gt; Events from email</i></p><img src=\"https://cxcs.microsoft.net/file/ccp/en-us/b72fb624-62cf-417e-a54e-037246e48c1a\" style=\"width: 400px;\" alt=\"user settings\"><p></p><p></p>\n\n<p><b><b>When this will happen:</b></b></p><p>We encourage providers to transition to Schema.org as early as possible, as continued reliance on legacy support is not sustainable. Organizations that do not migrate may experience a gradual decline in the accuracy, reliability, and consistency of automatically generated events. These issues cannot be fixed on the legacy stack, the only long-term solution is migration to <a href=\"http://Schema.org\">Schema.org</a> standards.</p>\n\n<p><b><b>How this affects your organization:</b></b></p>\n<p><b>Who is affected:</b></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Organizations whose users rely on Outlook’s <i>Events from email</i> feature.</li>\n<li>Partners and providers who send transactional emails (e.g., airlines, hotels, travel agencies, delivery services).</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><b>What will happen:</b></p><ul>\n<li>Emails that continue to rely on legacy extraction may experience increasing failures, missing events, and incorrect calendar entries over time.</li><li>Emails using <a href=\"http://Schema.org\">Schema.org</a> markup will continue to generate calendar events automatically.</li>\n<li>Partners using <a href=\"http://Schema.org\">Schema.org</a> markup report up to 30% higher engagement and more reliable event extraction.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><b><b>What you can do to prepare:</b></b></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Identify your Corporate travel partner(s) that are sending booking confirmation emails to your employees and reach out to them for adopting <a href=\"http://Schema.org\">Schema.org</a> support</li>\n<li>To determine whether a provider is using Legacy or <a href=\"http://Schema.org\">Schema.org</a>, you can safely assume most providers are still on Legacy- our data shows that 94% of providers remain on legacy extraction.</li>\n<li><span style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\">To get more assistance on onboarding a provider to <a href=\"http://Schema.org\">Schema.org</a>, please reach out to <a href=\"mailto://txppro@microsoft.com\">txppro@microsoft.com</a> along with your provider details/contacts and the domains from which these mails are sent, so they can be whitelisted. A detailed onboarding &amp; testing process will be shared.&nbsp;</span></li><li>Communicate this change to helpdesk staff.</li></ul>\n\n<p><b><b>Compliance considerations</b> </b></p>\nNo compliance considerations identified, review as appropriate for your organization.<p></p>",
