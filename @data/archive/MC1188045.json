    "Content": "We are announcing the Quality Evaluation Agent in Dynamics 365 Customer Service. This feature reached general availability on November 14, 2025. \n<br><br> \n<b>How does this affect me?</b><br>\nThe Quality Evaluation Agent (QEA) autonomously assesses cases, providing quality scores and detailed evaluation insights. The QEA utilizes the Evaluation Framework to assess customer interactions based on specific conditions. The framework offers full control over score calculations, through scoring and weighted sections configured in evaluation criteria.<br><br> \nSupervisors utilize the evaluation framework to define specific evaluation criteria and create evaluation plans. When these plans are executed, requests are sent to the Quality Evaluation Agent (QEA) to evaluate cases. The QEA processes these requests, generating evaluation responses with detailed reasoning for the predicted answers. Additionally, it produces quality scores and comprehensive evaluation summaries, including action plans for AI supervisors.\n<ul>\n<li>Evaluation Criteria: This feature allows supervisors to create a form containing questions with answer choices, scoring metrics, and detailed instructions for Quality Evaluation Automation (QEA). This criteria is used to assess interactions, with QEA predicting responses and assigning quality scores, providing insights into the overall quality score of the contact center.</li>\n<li>Evaluation Plan: This feature enables supervisors to establish plans that define the timing of evaluating interactions. Supervisors can select cases based on specific conditions and apply the appropriate evaluation criteria to conduct these evaluations systematically.\nThe QEA also provides insights for AI supervisors by summarizing all case evaluations conducted within customer service. It highlights action plans and recommendations on the quality insights dashboard.</li>\n</ul>\n<b>What action do I need to take?</b><br>\nThis message is for awareness, and no action is required.",
