As part of the advanced Teams Premium capabilities, users will have access to DALL-E, a text to image generator, which they can use for their backgrounds. This release of Custom Backgrounds for Announcement Posts will be rolling out across Microsoft Teams Desktop and Web for Channels 2.0 in English – US markets only. Non-US tenants may have noticed a temporary loss in the ability to upload an image. For tenants who do not have access to Designer, the ability to upload image will be made available again in early March 2024.
