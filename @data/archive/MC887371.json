The new Planner for the web will match Planner in Teams to enable your users to seamlessly switch between Teams and web.\n</p><p>A Microsoft 365 license is required to use the new Planner. While final pricing for Copilot in Planner (preview) has not been announced, if you have a Project Plan 3 license, Project Plan 5 license, or a premium Planner trial license, you can preview Copilot in Planner capabilities.\n</p><p>This message is associated with Microsoft 365 Roadmap ID <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?filters=&amp;searchterms=411777\" target=\"_blank\">411777</a>.</p><p><b>When this will happen:</b>\n</p><p>Targeted Release: We will begin rolling out early October 2024 and expect to complete by mid-October 2024.\n</p><p>General Availability (Worldwide): We will begin rolling out mid-October 2024 and expect to complete by late November 2024.\n</p><p>General Availability (GCC): We will begin rolling out late November 2024 and expect to complete by late January 2025.\n</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b>\n</p><p>The following features will not be available at launch but will be available by early 2025:\n</p><ul><li>Open plans associated with a Loop task list\n</li><li><i>Board</i> view in the <i>Assigned to me</i> view\n</li><li>Add <i>Assigned to me</i> tasks or a plan to an external calendar with an iCalendar link. <b>NOTE</b>: Existing iCalendar links will continue to work. New iCalendar link creation is not supported, and existing iCalendar links cannot be disabled while this feature is not available.\n</li><li>Undoing the deletion of a task</li></ul><p>As part of our efforts to simplify Planner, these existing features are not available in the new Planner due to low usage:\n</p><ul><li>Charts for pinned plans in Planner Hub\n</li><li><i>While you were away</i> notifications\n</li><li>Activity log of a task’s creation, assignments, and completion date in the task comments.\n</li><li>Links to group members, Microsoft Outlook conversations, and Microsoft OneNote notebook (you can still access these links in Outlook)\n</li><li>Menu option to <i>Leave plan\n</i></li><li>Suggested attachments\n</li><li><i>Charts view</i> and <i>Schedule view</i> on the <i>Assigned to me</i> page</li><li>Customized backgrounds for plans</li></ul><p>Planner will also now support Targeted release. For organizations that opt in to Targeted release, your organization will be the first to see the latest Planner updates and can help shape the product by providing early feedback. Planner does not support individuals opted into Targeted release. <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/admin/manage/release-options-in-office-365?view=o365-worldwide\" target=\"_blank\">Learn more about Targeted release</a>.\n</p><p>Lastly, after the new Planner for the web is rolled out, users can still access Project for the web. For this rollout, we will merge notification settings in the new Planner and Project for the web. Users will see identical notification options in the two apps, and the settings they choose will be reflected across both apps. Until a user reviews their notification settings, we will maintain what the user had set before the notifications are merged.\n</p><p>The new Planner for the web:\n</p><p><img src=\"https://img-prod-cms-rt-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/cms/api/am/imageFileData/RW1oFPu?ver=9f4c\" style=\"width: 400px;\" alt=\"user controls\">\n</p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b>\n</p><ul><li>The new Planner is on by default for users with the required licenses. This rollout will happen automatically by the specified date with no admin action required before the rollout.
