    "Content": "We are announcing the ability to use enhanced real-time translation (RTT) in Dynamics 365 Contact Center. This feature will reach public preview on October 31, 2025.<br><br>\n<b>How does this affect me?</b><br>\nWith this feature, you will have access to an out-of-box solution for translation services, removing the need for your own web resources in the channel settings. The global RTT settings will still be available until the general availability release. The new default settings for real-time translation include: \n<ul>\n<li>Service representatives inherit the custom default primary language for translation services as their user interface language.</li> \n<li>Configuration settings at the channel level rather than global, so each channel can have its own language settings.</li> \n<li>Channel-default language will be the fallback language based on confidence scores from translation services.</li> \n<li> An out-of-the-box web resource that gives representatives a default real-time translation for their conversations from Microsoft.</li> \n</ul>\nThe new open configurations enable translation during conversations and allow representatives to: \n<ul>\n<li>Turn the service on or off for each conversation.</li>\n<li>Manually change the language for receiving/sending and reading messages.</li>\n<li>Hide or view the original and translated versions of each text message separately and/or the whole transcript to avoid confusion and additional mental load.</li>\n<li>Retry translations if there are issues.</li>\n</ul>\n<b>What action do I need to take?</b><br>\nThis message is for awareness, and no action is required.",
