This feature will reach general availability on October 31, 2025.<br><br> \n\n<b>How does this affect me? </b><br> \nThis new intent-based consultation feature enhances customer service operations by intelligently guiding requests to the most suitable workgroup or queue. Leveraging Copilot’s knowledge base, the system recommends the right expert or team, making the consultation process faster and more precise. <br><br> \n\nTo enable this feature when available, administrators should activate the Customer Intent Agent and set up intent-based routing within the Copilot Service admin center.
