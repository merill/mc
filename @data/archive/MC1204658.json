This feature will reach general availability on January 23, 2026.<br><br><b>How does this affect me?</b><br>Simulation helps admins understand how Case Management Agent would perform field prediction so that they can evaluate quality checks and make determinations about the enablement of this feature in production. Admins can choose historical case records or upload an Excel file containing email, chat, or voice transcripts, and view how Case Management Agent would have made field predictions based on the historical records or uploaded data. They can make changes to the Case Management Agent configuration, and quickly re-run simulation to check for improvements in prediction quality.<br><br><b>What action do I need to take?</b><br>This message is for awareness, and no action is required.",
