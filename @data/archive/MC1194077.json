    "Content": "<b><b>Introduction</b></b>\n<p>We’re introducing <b>new opt-in cmdlet parameters</b> in <i>Microsoft Purview Data lifecycle management </i>that help administrators remove retention holds from inactive mailboxes. The new <b>ExcludeFromAllHolds parameter</b><i style=\"\"> </i>removes all applicable holds except eDiscovery holds, litigation hold, and restrictive retention policies, enabling permanent deletion of mailboxes while continuing to respect compliance requirements.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The <b>RemoveComplianceTagHold switch</b>, in contrast, removes only the Compliance Tag–based hold (ComplianceTagHoldApplied) from a mailbox. This gives administrators more granular control when they want to adjust Compliance Tag enforcement without excluding the mailbox from other holds.</p>\n<p>This message is associated with Microsoft 365 Roadmap ID <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?rtc=1%26filters=537204\" target=\"_blank\">537204</a>.</p>\n\n<b><b>When this will happen</b></b>\n<p><b>General Availability (Worldwide, GCC, GCC-High, DoD): </b>Rollout begins in&nbsp;<b>early December 2025</b> and completes by<b> late December 2025</b>.</p>\n\n<b><b>How this affects your organization</b></b>\n<p><b>Who is affected:</b> Admins managing inactive mailboxes in<i> Exchange Online</i> and <i>on-premises Exchange</i>.</p>\n<p><b>What will happen:</b></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Admins can use the new cmdlet to remove multiple types of retention holds from inactive mailboxes in a single operation.</li>\n<li>Mailboxes can be permanently deleted after holds are removed, provided no legal or restrictive retention policies remain.</li>\n<li>This <b>feature is opt-in</b> and <b>requires explicit execution of the cmdlet</b>.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<b><b>What you can do to prepare</b></b>\n<ul>\n<li>Review compliance requirements before using the cmdlet.</li>\n<li>Obtain approval from your compliance team prior to execution.</li>\n<li>Update internal documentation to reflect this new capability.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<b><b>Compliance considerations</b></b><table class=\"table table-bordered\"><tbody><tr><td><b>Question</b></td><td><b style=\"\">Answer</b></td></tr><tr><td>Does the change alter how existing customer data is processed, stored, or accessed (such as documents, emails, chats)?</td><td>Yes, Once the holds are removed, the data will no longer be preserved. Inactive mailboxes will transition to a soft-deleted state and will be permanently deleted after 30 days.</td></tr><tr><td>Does the change modify, interrupt, or disable capabilities in Purview such as retention policies, holds, or deletion workflows?</td><td>Exchange administrators can remove organization-wide retention policies, user-specific retention policies, delay holds, delay-release holds, and Compliance Tag holds. This enables them to permanently delete mailboxes, provided no other legal or restrictive holds are applied.</td></tr><tr><td>Does the change modify how users can access, export, delete, or correct their personal data within<i> Microsoft 365 services</i> (GDPR Data Subject Rights)?</td><td>After removing the permitted holds from mailboxes, users can permanently delete them, provided no other legal or restrictive holds remain in place.</td></tr></tbody></table><p></p>",
