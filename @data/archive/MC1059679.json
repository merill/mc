    "Content": "<p>Updated June 26, 2025: We have updated the content. Thank you for your patience.</p><p>In Microsoft Purview | Insider Risk Management (IRM), policy tuning analysis provides admins with a real-time prediction of the number of users in a tenant that could potentially match a given set of policy conditions. After this rollout, policy tuning analysis will support insider risk policies that are scoped for priority content.</p><p>This message is associated with Microsoft 365 Roadmap ID <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?filters=&amp;searchterms=378409\" target=\"_blank\">378409</a>.</p><p>This message is associated with MC786326 (about the preview for this feature that started in May 2024).</p><p><b>When this will happen:</b></p><p>General Availability (WW, GCC, GCC High, DoD): We will begin rolling out late June 2025 (previously mid-June) and expect to complete by late July 2025 (previously mid-July).</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b></p><p>After this rollout, admins can use real-time analytics for policies scoped for priority content to help predict the number of users that could potentially match a given set of policy conditions. This feature enables admins to quickly adjust the selection of indicators and thresholds of activity occurrence so they can efficiently translate their insider risk strategies into pragmatic controls and keep from having too few or too many alerts.</p><p>1. In IRM, Navigate to <i>Settings &gt; Insider Risk Management &gt; Analytics,</i> turn on <i>Analytics, </i>and then select <i>Save</i>.\n</p><p><img src=\"https://cxcs.microsoft.net/file/ccp/en-us/36486c44-65f9-43cb-9438-8b1ec377a6a2\" style=\"width: 400px;\" alt=\"admin controls\">\n</p><p>2.

Configure the rest of the policy as applicable and save it.</p><p>7. 1-2 days after the policy is saved, edit the policy again and navigate to the indicator thresholds page where insights on user activity containing the scoped priority content for each indicator will be visible under <i>Choose your own thresholds:</i>\n</p><p><img src=\"https://cxcs.microsoft.net/file/ccp/en-us/bc32f39d-116d-4375-8180-8da88cd2c365\" style=\"width: 400px;\" alt=\"admin controls\">\n</p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b></p><p>This rollout will happen automatically by the specified date with no admin action required before the rollout. Review your current configuration to determine the impact for your organization. You may want to notify your users about this change and update any relevant documentation.</p><p>This change will be available by default for admins to configure. To use this feature, admins will need to enable <i>Analytics </i>in Insider risk management &gt; <i>Settings.</i> After <i>Analytics </i>is enabled and insights are populated, admins will be able to see real-time predictions in policies scoped to all users/groups and scored only for priority content.</p><p>Microsoft Purview Insider Risk Management correlates various signals to identify potential malicious or inadvertent insider risks, such as IP theft, data leakage and security violations. Insider Risk Management enables customers to create policies based on their own internal policies, governance and organizational requirements. Built with privacy by design, users are pseudonymized by default, and role-based access controls and audit logs are in place to help ensure user-level privacy.\n</p><p>You can access the Insider Risk Management solution in the <a href=\"https://purview.microsoft.com/compliance\" target=\"_blank\">Microsoft Purview compliance portal</a>.</p><p>Learn more: <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/purview/insider-risk-management-settings-policy-indicators?tabs=purview-portal#use-real-time-analytics-recommendations-to-set-thresholds\" target=\"_blank\">Configure policy indicators in insider risk management | Microsoft Learn</a></p>",
