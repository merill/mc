    "Content": "We are announcing the ability to automate browsers using direct control without extensions \nin Power Automate. This feature will reach general availability on November 5, 2025. <br><br> \n<b>How does this affect me? </b><br>\nThis feature eliminates the need for browser extensions, enabling you to more easily set up automation. Direct browser control improves reliability across environments and supports scenarios where extensions are restricted. Built-in failover ensures flows run smoothly even if the primary method fails. <br><br>\nThe <i>Launch browser</i> actions include a new option to choose between extension-based automation and direct browser control. With direct browser control, interactions are managed through the browser’s native drivers. The enhanced failover option provides increased reliability by automatically switching to an alternative automation method if the primary one encounters an error during execution. <br><br>\n<b>What action do I need to take? </b><br>\nThis message is for awareness, and no action is required. <br><br>\nIf you would like more information on this feature, please visit <a href=\"https://aka.ms/12594/automate-browsers-using-direct-control-without-extensions\" target=\"_blank\">Automate browsers using direct control without extensions</a>.",
