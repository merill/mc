Before the rollout, the APIs for tabs in chat and channels were only available for apps used during meetings and calls. After the rollout, developers will be able to update apps using the existing Live Share RSC permissions for their meeting extensions to use these APIs for more than meetings.\n</p><p>This message is associated with Microsoft 365 Roadmap ID <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?filters=&amp;searchterms=389141\" target=\"_blank\">389141</a>.\n</p><p><b>When this will happen:</b>\n</p><p>General Availability (Worldwide, GCC): We will begin rolling out mid-May 2024 and expect to complete by late May 2024.\n</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b>\n</p><p>This rollout is for Teams for Desktop, Web, and Mac. This rollout is not for Teams iOS or Android. \n</p><p>After the rollout, Microsoft Teams applications that support the Live Share Resource-specific consent (RSC) permission(s) can update their chat/channel tabs and collab stage views to use the same Live Share APIs that were previously available only during meetings and calls. In chat contexts, apps must have the <code>LiveShareSession.ReadWrite.Chat</code> RSC permission to use these APIs. In channel contexts, apps must have the <code>LiveShareSession.ReadWrite.Group</code> RSC permission to use these APIs. No new app permissions are introduced with this rollout.\n</p><p>All applications enabled in your tenant using the existing Live Share permission will be eligible for this feature.\n</p><p>Example of how an application can use Teams Live Share in a channel tab:\n</p><p><img src=\"https://img-prod-cms-rt-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/cms/api/am/imageFileData/RW1kieg?ver=a4bd\" style=\"width: 400px;\" alt=\"user controls\">\n</p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b>\n</p><p>If you have enabled a Teams app to use Live Share during meetings, and you do not want that app to use these APIs in chat and/or channel contexts, disable the app before this feature rolls out. No other action is needed.\n</p><p>You may want to notify your users about this change and update any relevant documentation as appropriate.\n</p><p>Learn more: <a href=\"https://aka.ms/teamsliveshare\" target=\"_blank\">Live Share overview - Teams | Microsoft Learn</a></p>",
