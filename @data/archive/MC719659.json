    "Content": "<p>Updated April 25, 2024: We are addressing the feedback of the users about the account picker presence on pre-join screen in case user has one account and joining a meeting within a tenant. As a result, we will not show account picker in such cases. However this change will take place only during Worldwide release. Targeted release users with one account will see account picker in case they have just one account and joining a meeting within the tenant. Please consider it as a known issue/limitation which will be fixed with general release.</p><p>Starting in April 2024 and rolling out gradually, the Microsoft Teams desktop app on Windows and Mac will let you use any type of Teams account (work, school, or personal). As in classic Teams, admins can control their users’ sign-in capabilities with group policies.</p><p>Users will be able to add and access their additional accounts in the upper right corner of Teams by selecting their profile picture. Teams personal account users can connect and collaborate with the people and groups in their life through <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-teams/communities\" target=\"_blank\">Communities in Teams</a> by adding a personal Microsoft account (MSA).
