    "Content": "<p>Updated October 15, 2024: We have updated the rollout timeline below. Thank you for your patience.</p><p>Coming soon to Microsoft Teams: A streamlined installation process to simplify how users add an app to Teams. This update aims to reduce friction and improve user engagement with apps by offering a more intuitive process from discovery to use. We've reduced the number of steps it takes for a user to install an app and start using it in chats, channels, and meetings. This message applies to Teams on Windows desktop, Mac desktop, and on the web.\n</p><p><b>When this will happen:</b>\n</p><p>Targeted Release: We will begin rolling out mid-October 2024 (previously early October) and expect to complete by late October 2024 (previously early October).</p><p>General Availability (Worldwide): We will begin rolling out late October 2024 (previously early October) and expect to complete by early November 2024 (previously mid-October). \n</p><p>\n</p><p>General Availability (GCC): We will begin rolling out early November 2024 (previously late October) and expect to complete by mid-November 2024 (previously early November).</p><p> <b>How this will affect your organization:</b><br></p><p>Before this rollout: The process to install apps in Teams is more complicated, less intuitive, and has more steps.\n</p><p>After this rollout, installing apps in Teams will be more efficient and user-friendly. The new installation process provides users with a more streamlined approach to using apps in chats, channels, and meetings as well as for personal use. <b>Note:</b> This update does not require you to change current app management practices. Users may notice the streamlined process.\n</p><p>This new process is on by default.\n</p><p>Adding a new app from Apps tab on the left side of Teams, with a single <i>Add</i> or <i>Open</i> button:\n</p><p><img src=\"https://img-prod-cms-rt-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/cms/api/am/imageFileData/RW1oeYC?ver=cda8\" style=\"width: 400px;\" alt=\"user controls\">\n</p><p>For apps that work in chats, channels, and meetings, the user can search for a chat, channel, or meeting where they can use the app or select a chat, channel, or meeting from recommendations based on the user's recent interactions on Teams:\n</p><p><img src=\"https://img-prod-cms-rt-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/cms/api/am/imageFileData/RW1oeYB?ver=c13c\" style=\"width: 400px;\" alt=\"user controls\">\n</p><p><b>Note</b>: For all users: If an app already exists as a configured tab in an existing chat, channel, or meeting, selecting the same scope (chat, channel, or meeting) will trigger a new configured tab in that scope. Users can open an existing configured tab in the chat, channel, or meeting by navigating to it in Teams.\n</p><p>Users with Microsoft Copilot for Microsoft 365 licenses can start using the Copilot extension in the Copilot app on Teams.\n</p><p>Users with Microsoft Copilot for Microsoft 365 licenses who want to install an app with Copilot extensions will be presented the option to <i>Open in Copilot:</i>\n</p><p><img src=\"https://img-prod-cms-rt-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/cms/api/am/imageFileData/RW1ofwT?ver=b57b\" style=\"width: 400px;\" alt=\"user controls\">\n</p><p>Selecting <i>Open in Copilot</i> will take Copilot users to the Copilot app that displays a list of Copilot extensions they can choose to use in their chats, channels, and meetings:\n</p><p><img src=\"https://img-prod-cms-rt-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/cms/api/am/imageFileData/RW1okCm?ver=50d7\" style=\"width: 400px;\" alt=\"user controls\">\n</p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b>\n</p><p>Admins should ensure that their teams are aware of the new installation process, especially if your organization heavily uses apps on Teams. No specific actions are required from admins, but communicating this change to users may help them take full advantage of the new process.\n</p><p>Documentation for users: <a href=\"https://support.microsoft.com/office/add-an-app-to-microsoft-teams-b2217706-f7ed-4e64-8e96-c413afd02f77\" target=\"_blank\">Add an app to Microsoft Teams - Microsoft Support</a> (will be updated before rollout begins)</p>",
