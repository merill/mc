    "Content": "<p><b><b>Introduction</b></b>\n</p><p>Agent in Viva Engage communities are now available in Public Preview. Community admins can add agents to communities to enhance knowledge sharing by drafting answers to questions without best or verified answers based on community content.<br><br>Shortly after public preview begins, we'll be enhancing agents in communities with SharePoint grounding to improve the accuracy and relevance of AI-generated answers. This update allows the agent to use content from SharePoint sites that community members can access, helping ensure responses are contextually grounded and backed by trusted sources. Agents in communities will only draft answers with content that all community members have access to. You can set up your agent with before SharePoint grounding is available and add it later.</p><p><b><b>When this will happen:</b></b></p><ul>\n<li><b>Agents in communities Public Preview:</b> Begins September 18th, expected to be complete by late September</li><li><b>SharePoint Grounding Public Preview (Worldwide):</b> Begins late September 2025, expected to complete by early October 2025</li>\n<li><b>General Availability (Worldwide):</b> Begins late January 2026, expected to complete by late February 2026</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<b><b>How this affects your organization:</b></b>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Who is affected:</b> Viva Engage community admins with Microsoft 365 Copilot licenses; Global and Engage admins managing Viva Engage networks</li>\n<li><b>What will happen:</b></li>\n<ul>\n<li><b>During Public Preview:</b></li>\n<ul>\n<li>Admins can opt their network into the preview via the <i>Engage admin center</i>: <i>Engage admin center</i> &gt; <i>Analytics and AI</i> &gt; <i>Enable Community Agent Public Preview.</i><p><i>Figure i.
