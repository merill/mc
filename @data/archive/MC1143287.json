You can select a site and compare its contents and settings with all other sites. The report provides a similarity percentage based on file content and highlights differences in site configurations and policies. This helps streamline governance by identifying opportunities to align settings across similar sites.</p>\n\n<p><b>When this will happen</b></p><p>\n</p><ul>\n<li><b>Public Preview (Worldwide):</b> Rollout begins early April 2025 and is expected to complete by late August 2025.</li>\n<li><b>General Availability (Worldwide):</b> Rollout begins late August 2025 and is expected to complete by late December 2025.</li>\n</ul><p></p>\n\n<p><b>How this affects your organization</b></p><p>This feature is optional and does not impact existing site configurations or user experiences.
