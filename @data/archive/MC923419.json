    "Content": "<p>Updated November 20, 2024: We have updated the rollout timeline below. Thank you for your patience.</p><p>Before this rollout, guest sharing for Microsoft Loop components, pages, and workspaces is available for tenants that have not configured sensitivity labels, as communicated in MC736437 <i>Microsoft Loop: Guest Sharing</i> (March 2024). After this rollout and the rollout of Microsoft Information Protection for Loop workspaces, B2B (business to business) guest sharing for Loop workspaces, pages, and components will be available for all tenants, including those who have configured sensitivity labels, subject to admin policy. If admins configure the policy, users will be able to share Loop workspaces, pages, and components with people outside of your tenant. This message applies to Loop on the web and on iOS/Android devices.\n</p><p>This message is related to MC923176&nbsp;<i>Microsoft Loop: Sensitivity labels at the container level</i> (November 2024).\n</p><p><b>Note: </b>Loop will respect your Microsoft OneDrive and Microsoft SharePoint sharing settings. If your tenant does not allow sharing with guests, then it will prevent guest sharing of Loop workspaces, pages, and components as well.\n</p><p><b>When this will happen:</b>\n</p><p>General Availability (Worldwide, GCC): We will begin rolling out in early December 2024 (previously early November) and expect to complete by early January 2025 (previously early December).</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b>\n</p><p>After this rollout, if admins have configured Microsoft SharePoint for B2B guest sharing, users in your organization will be able to share Loop workspaces, pages, and components with people outside of your tenant. Users can share pages and components with the <i>People you choose</i> option. Guest users cannot create workspaces.\n</p><p>The user experience: The <i>Share</i> button in the top left of the Loop app:\n</p><p><img src=\"https://img-prod-cms-rt-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/cms/api/am/imageFileData/RW1oYtJ?ver=8f37\" style=\"width: 400px;\" alt=\"user controls\">\n</p><p>Sharing menu with option to share workspace, page, or component:\n</p><p><img src=\"https://img-prod-cms-rt-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/cms/api/am/imageFileData/RW1oYtK?ver=a392\" style=\"width: 400px;\" alt=\"user controls\">\n</p><p>Copy link dialog box with the <i>Settings</i> icon:\n</p><p><img src=\"https://img-prod-cms-rt-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/cms/api/am/imageFileData/RW1p3x6?ver=0e80\" style=\"width: 400px;\" alt=\"user controls\">\n</p><p>Sharing dialog box with <i>People you choose</i> selected:\n</p><p><img src=\"https://img-prod-cms-rt-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/cms/api/am/imageFileData/RW1p62G?ver=1f62\" style=\"width: 400px;\" alt=\"user controls\">\n</p><p>Admins: You can configure sharing of Loop workspaces, pages, and components with guests by enabling these policies in Microsoft SharePoint admin center &gt; <i>Policies &gt; Sharing:\n</i></p><ol><li>Set the organization-level external sharing settings for to allow content to be shared with <i>New and existing guests</i> or <i>Existing guests.</i></li><li>Enable the B2B collaboration with external guests.
