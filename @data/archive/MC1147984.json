When users report messages they believe were incorrectly flagged, those submissions are stored in the Microsoft Defender portal under the Submissions tab.</td></tr><tr><td>Does the change introduce or significantly modify AI/ML or agent capabilities that interact with or provide access to customer data?</td><td>Yes. User feedback on incorrectly flagged messages is used to improve detection models, which modifies how AI/ML systems classify threats over time.</td></tr><tr><td>Does the change include an admin control, and can it be controlled through Entra ID group membership?</td><td>Yes. Admins can enable or disable the feature in both the Teams admin center and the Microsoft Defender portal. Access to these controls can be managed through Entra ID group membership.</td></tr></tbody></table><p></p>",
