Thank you for your patience.</p><p><b>Introduction</b></p><p>Microsoft Teams now enables users to report messages they believe were incorrectly flagged as security threats in chats and channels. This capability is available to organizations with Microsoft Defender for Office 365 Plan 2 or Microsoft Defender XDR. It empowers users to provide feedback on false positives, helping improve detection accuracy and strengthen organizational security.</p><p>This feature will be available across <b>Microsoft Teams on Android, Desktop (Windows), iOS, Mac, and Web</b> platforms, ensuring broad accessibility for users regardless of device.</p><p>This feature is associated with Microsoft 365 Roadmap ID <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?filters=&amp;searchterms=501202\" target=\"_blank\">501202</a>.</p><p><b>When this will happen</b></p><p><b>Targeted Release (Worldwide):</b> Begins in early September 2025; expected completion by mid-September 2025.</p><p><b>General Availability (Worldwide): </b>Begins in early November 2025; expected completion by mid-November 2025.</p><p><b>How this affects your organization</b></p><p>Users will be able to report messages they believe contain URLs that were incorrectly flagged as malicious:</p><p>&nbsp;<img src=\"https://cxcs.microsoft.net/static/public/messagecenter/neutral/e84533a1-b3b6-4b82-87a2-47334577b217/1a6645547c71b286d07bcf8afc3f28f4d46eb45e.png\" style=\"width: 400px;\" alt=\"user settings\"></p><ul><li>During <b>Targeted Release</b>, the feature is <b>off by default</b> in Teams.</li><li>At <b>General Availability</b>, the feature will be <b>on by default</b> in Teams.

When users report messages they believe were incorrectly flagged, those submissions are stored in the Microsoft Defender portal under the Submissions tab.</td></tr><tr><td>Does the change introduce or significantly modify AI/ML or agent capabilities that interact with or provide access to customer data?</td><td>Yes. User feedback on incorrectly flagged messages is used to improve detection models, which modifies how AI/ML systems classify threats over time.</td></tr><tr><td>Does the change include an admin control, and can it be controlled through Entra ID group membership?</td><td>Yes. Admins can enable or disable the feature in both the Teams admin center and the Microsoft Defender portal. Access to these controls can be managed through Entra ID group membership.</td></tr></tbody></table><p></p>\n\nAdditional Resources: <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/end-user-reporting-security\" target=\"_blank\">End user reporting for security - Microsoft Teams | Microsoft Learn</a><p></p>",
