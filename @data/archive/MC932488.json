    "Content": "<p>Updated December 10, 2024: We have updated the rollout timeline below. Thank you for your patience.</p><p>Coming soon for Microsoft Teams: New DVR (digital video recording) functionality for all town halls. This new feature will allow town hall attendees on Windows desktop or the web to interact with a live streaming town hall in the same way they would interact with recorded content. DVR functionality in the town hall enables event attendees to pause and move forward or back in a town hall, navigate to any previous timestamp, and other abilities, making it more convenient to interact with a town hall more and easier to digest the content being presented. This feature is available for Teams town halls from all organizers, regardless of the license assigned to the organizer.\n</p><p>This message is associated with Microsoft 365 Roadmap ID <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?filters=&amp;searchterms=422804\" target=\"_blank\">422804</a>.\n</p><p><b>When this will happen:</b>\n</p><p>Targeted Release: We will begin rolling out early February 2025 (previously early January) and expect to complete by mid-February 2025 (previously mid-January).\n</p><p>General Availability (Worldwide): We will begin rolling out mid-February 2025 (previously mid-January) and expect to complete by late February (previously late January).\n</p><p>General Availability (GCC): We will begin rolling out late February 2025 (previously late January) and expect to complete by early March 2025 (previously early February)</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b>\n</p><p>After this rollout, the DVR controls will appear when attendees hover their mouse over the content being presented in the town hall.
