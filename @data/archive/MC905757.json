Thank you for your patience.</p><p>Coming soon for Microsoft SharePoint: Site owners will be able to create font packages and themes for their sites and experiences by combining the branding assets that the organization provides or by creating their own.\n</p><p>The <i>Change the look</i> experience will contain branding created in the SharePoint brand center (or with Microsoft PowerShell) for their organization as well as their own local site branding. These will continue to be previewed and applied via the Change the Look experience for your sites and experiences.\n</p><p><img src=\"https://img-prod-cms-rt-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/cms/api/am/imageFileData/RW1pN2h?ver=63cd\" style=\"width: 400px;\" alt=\"user controls\">\n</p><p><img src=\"https://img-prod-cms-rt-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/cms/api/am/imageFileData/RW1pOZn?ver=6998\" style=\"width: 300px;\" alt=\"user controls\">\n</p><p>This message is associated with Microsoft 365 Roadmap ID <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?filters=&amp;searchterms=375500\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); font-family: sans-serif; font-weight: 400;\">375500</a>.\n</p><p><b>When this will happen:</b>\n</p><p>Targeted Release: We will begin rolling out early October 2024 and expect to complete by late October 2024.\n</p><p>General Availability (Worldwide, GCC, GCC High, DoD): We will begin rolling out early November 2024 and expect to complete by late November 2024.\n</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b></p><p>As communicated in MC905757 Microsoft SharePoint: Customize your individual sites and experiences with fonts and themes (October 2024), we are introducing a new site branding feature for SharePoint. We are adding an additional capability to this feature allowing site owners to copy branding assets utilized in another site for use within their site. This will create an independent copy of these site branding assets in the destination site.</p><p><img src=\"https://img-prod-cms-rt-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/cms/api/am/imageFileData/RW1qpkz?ver=a083\" style=\"width: 412.995px;\"> \n</p><p>Notes:\n</p><ol><li>Themes will continue to be inherited from the hub for associated sites.\n</li><li>Searching and copying site branding across sites in different geographies is not currently supported.</li></ol><p>Site owners will be able to create, rename, and delete themes and font packages (where available in a tenant). This will not have any impact on the themes and font packages provided from the organization or from Microsoft.</p><p>\n</p><p>Before this rollout: Site owners have limited ability to customize their sites and experiences with branding.\n</p><p>After this rollout, site branding adds an additional option to customize a single site with a unique theme and font package created and managed by the site owners, adding this option to the branding available from your organization and from Microsoft.\n</p><p><img src=\"https://img-prod-cms-rt-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/cms/api/am/imageFileData/RW1pDG3?ver=7a3b\" style=\"width: 300px;\" alt=\"user controls\">\n</p><p>Note: Themes will continue to be inherited from the hub for associated sites.</p><p>Site owners will be able to create, rename, and delete themes and font packages (where available in a tenant).
