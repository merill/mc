    "Content": "<p style=\"\">Updated September 26, 2024: We have updated the rollout timeline below. Thank you for your patience.</p><p style=\"\">This new Microsoft Teams feature for Town Hall empowers organizers, presenters, and even external presenters to engage in private discussions before, during, and after their virtual events. This functionality facilitates real-time collaboration, whether prepping pre-event, coordinating seamlessly during presentations, or debriefing post-event, this feature is your ultimate tool for driving impactful and successful virtual events.<br></p><p>On the Town Hall Scheduling form, the event organizer must define their presenters and external presenters for this exclusive group chat to be created. After the event is created, the organizer can access this chat before/after&nbsp;the event from the Town Hall Scheduling form, the Teams Calendar, or the event's Details page. Presenters (and external presenters from guests and federated tenants) can access this chat before/after&nbsp;the event from the Teams Calendar or the event's Details page. This chat will appear in their chat pane.&nbsp;During&nbsp;the event, organizers, presenters, and external presenters (including anonymous presenters) can access this chat from within the in-meeting chat by selecting the tab for Organizers and Presenters.</p>\n<p>This message is associated with Microsoft 365 Roadmap ID <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?filters=&amp;searchterms=377303\" target=\"_blank\">377303</a></p>\n<p><b>When this will happen:</b></p><p>Targeted Release: We will begin rolling out mid-November 2024 (previously mid-September) and expect to complete by late November 2024 (previously late September).</p><p>Worldwide: We will begin rolling out early January 2025 (previously late September) and expect to complete by mid-January 2025 (previously late August).</p>\n\n<p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b></p>\n\n<p>This feature will automatically be available in Microsoft Teams when it is released.
