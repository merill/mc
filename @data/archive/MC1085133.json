    "Content": "<p>Updated December 3, 2025: We have updated the timeline. This feature will now be included as part of another update referenced in <a href=\"https://lynx.office.net/messagecenter/MC796790\">MC796790</a>. Administrators will gain the ability to manage Microsoft 365 certified SaaS applications through org-wide settings for third-party apps. No changes will be applied to tenant-wide settings unless initiated by an administrator. Thank you for your patience.</p><p>This feature will empower administrators to manage the availability of trusted Microsoft Teams apps based on rules, for enhanced security. Admins will be able to manage Microsoft 365 certified apps in the Teams admin center through a new control in <i>Org-wide settings</i>. You can further customize the availability of these apps based on permissions accessed and publisher names. The system automatically checks the Microsoft 365 certified apps that meet all the conditions you specify and makes those apps available.&nbsp;<b>&nbsp;</b></p><p>This message is associated with Microsoft 365 Roadmap ID <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?filters=&amp;searchterms=485712\" target=\"_blank\">485712</a>.\n</p><p><b>When this will happen:</b>\n</p><p>General Availability (Worldwide): We will begin rolling out mid-February 2026 (previously mid-January) and expect to complete by late February 2026 (previously early February).</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b></p><p>Before this rollout, you cannot manage at bulk the availability of Microsoft 365 certified apps. They are only controlled by third-party app tenant settings.\n</p><p>After this rollout, you can manage Microsoft 365 certified apps availability from org-wide settings in the Teams admin center at <i>Manage apps &gt; Actions &gt; Org-wide app settings &gt; Microsoft 365 certified apps</i>.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cxcs.microsoft.net/file/ccp/en-us/e2c6ba81-7623-471a-8d06-0b6ad6e2ef00\" style=\"width: 400px;\" alt=\"admin settings\"></p><p>You can configure additional criteria from the <i>Customize availability </i>option:</p><p><img src=\"https://cxcs.microsoft.net/file/ccp/en-us/c2d0f382-0897-432d-8a46-028de82b2e2d\" style=\"width: 400px;\" alt=\"admin settings\">\n</p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b></p><p>This rollout will happen automatically by the specified dates with no admin action required before or after the rollout.
