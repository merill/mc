    "Content": "We are announcing the ability to design proactive customer engagement workflows in Dynamics 365 Contact Center. This feature will reach general availability on October 31, 2025.<br><br> \n\n<b>How does this affect me? </b><br> \n\nThis feature allows Journey authors to define dynamic caller ID rules based on customer attributes, allowing each call to present a trusted and contextually relevant identity. Additionally, journeys can optionally reserve customer service representatives before call initiation, ensuring they're prepared and available, reducing wait times and increasing first-call resolution. <br><br> \n\nEnhancements to dial modes include a predictive dialer that automatically initiates calls based on agent availability and customer responsiveness. This dialer helps journey authors efficiently scale outreach across large customer segments. A preview timer gives service representatives a configurable window to review customer history before the call begins. <br><br> \n\n<b>What action do I need to take? </b><br> \nThis message is for awareness, and no action is required. <br><br> \n\nIf you would like more information on this feature, please visit <a href=\"https://aka.ms/12081/tailor-proactive-engagements-configuration-options\" target=\"_blank\">Tailor proactive engagements with configuration options</a>.",
