This update introduces the AI Admin Role and Global reader role, which enables designated administrators to manage or give read-only capability to AI-powered Copilot Search experiences that interact with customer data across Microsoft 365 services.</td></tr><tr><td>Does the change alter how existing customer data is processed, stored, or accessed (e.g., documents, emails, chats, etc.)?</td><td>Yes. AI-powered search may surface data across services based on user permissions, potentially altering how data is accessed and presented.</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;=Does the change provide end users any new way of interacting with generative AI?&nbsp;</td><td>Yes. Copilot Search enhances the user experience by enabling generative AI-powered search capabilities across Microsoft 365.</td></tr><tr><td>Does the change alter how admins can monitor, report on, or demonstrate compliance activities (e.g., Purview or admin reporting)?</td><td>No.  There is no new governance and monitoring capabilities for Copilot Search. But, with this role AI admins will be able to manage the existing Acronyms and Bookmark configurations with Copilot Search. Global Reader will give them read-only capabilities to the same.&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td>Does the change include an admin control, and can it be controlled through Entra ID group membership?&nbsp;</td><td>Yes. AI Admin Role and Global Reader access to Copilot Search capabilities can be assigned and controlled through Microsoft Entra ID group membership.</td></tr></tbody></table><p></p>",
