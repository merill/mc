This feature will reach general availability on March 20, 2026.<br><br><b>How does this affect me?</b><br>This feature improves consent-based segments to provide clear and consistent consent evaluation, allowing you to trust that the audience you build truly reflects the consent choices your customers have made. Key improvements introduced by this feature include: \n<ul>\n    <li>Build audiences that follow the same consent rules used in journey execution, ensuring predictable and accurate membership. </li>\n    <li>Select compliance profiles, purposes, channels, topics, and recipient fields with clear defaults that simplify setup. </li>\n    <li>Use “Will send” and “Will not send” options that automatically adjust to the enforcement model for your chosen purpose and channel. </li>\n    <li>Build audiences that include only people who explicitly opted in when working with a nonrestrictive enforcement model, giving you full control when you want to target confirmed subscribers. </li>\n</ul>\n<b>What action do I need to take?</b><br>This message is for awareness and no action is required.",
