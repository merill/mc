    "Content": "<p>Updated January 28, 2026: We have updated the timeline. Thank you for your patience.&nbsp;</p><p><b><b>Introduction</b></b></p><p></p><p>The <b>Rate My Call survey</b> is a feedback screen that the Teams client will occasionally present to users after their Teams call or meeting has completed. Currently, the rating presents 1-5 stars on the first page and a list of potential issues (called <b>problem tokens</b>) on the second page.</p><p>We will be rolling out a new streamlined feedback experience for Teams on Windows, Mac, and Web that presents the feedback on a single screen with a <b>thumbs up</b> / <b>thumbs down rating system</b> and <b>problem tokens</b> for the user to select, plus an area to provide details. In testing, we found higher feedback returns with this new design, and clearer insights into call quality issues.</p><p>Screenshot 1: <i>New Rate My Call User Interface</i></p><p><img src=\"https://cxcs.microsoft.net/file/ccp/en-us/3672c1c2-9cf3-4b8f-91f5-2800ba72ab34\" style=\"width: 400px;\" alt=\"user settings\"></p><p><b><b>When this will happen:</b></b></p><ul>\n<li><b>General Availability/Targeted Release:</b>&nbsp;Rollout begins mid-February 2026 (previously late January), completes by late February 2026 (previously late January).</li>\n</ul>\n\n<b><b>How this affects your organization:</b></b><p></p><p>\n</p><p><b>Who is affected:</b> Users of Microsoft Teams on Windows desktop, Mac, and Web clients</p>\n<p><b>What will happen:</b></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Users will see a new <b>Rate My Call</b> screen after calls and meetings</li>\n<li>The new screen includes:\n  <ul>\n    <li>Thumbs up / thumbs down rating</li>\n    <li>Optional problem tokens</li>\n    <li>Optional free-text field for additional details</li>\n  </ul>\n</li>\n<li><b>Feedback Rating values</b> in Call Quality Dashboard (CQD) will change:\n  <ul>\n    <li><b>5:</b> Thumbs up / Good</li>\n    <li><b>1:</b> Thumbs down / Had issues</li>\n    <li><b>0:</b> Survey shown but not submitted</li>\n    <li><b>Null: </b>Survey not shown</li>\n  </ul>\n</li>\n<li>Problem tokens will still be recorded even if a rating (thumbs up or down) is not submitted</li>\n<li>Admins may notice an increase in poor feedback metrics due to the new rating method; this does not reflect a decline in service quality</li>\n</ul>\n\n<b><b>What you can do to prepare:</b></b><p></p><p>\n</p><ul>\n<li>Communicate this change to helpdesk and support staff</li>\n<li>Update internal documentation to reflect the new feedback format</li>\n<li>Monitor PCR (Poor Call Rate) telemetry until it stabilizes, then set your own threshold</li>\n</ul><p><b><b>Compliance considerations:</b></b></p><p>No compliance considerations identified, review as appropriate for your organization.</p>\n\n<b><b>FAQ</b></b><p></p><p></p><p><b>Q: Will a higher PCR mean calls are worse?</b><br>\nA: No. The new design captures more dissatisfied users by reporting a higher willingness to report poor calls. The increase is a measurement effect, not a quality regression.</p>\n\n<p><b>Q: What is the new PCR target or threshold for your workstreams?</b><br>\nA: We cannot provide a fixed PCR threshold. Your action is to monitor your own PCR telemetry until it stabilizes (both volume and value relatively flat), then set your threshold. Stabilization may take weeks and once the data converges, you can then set your own.</p><p></p>",

This may increase reported poor call rates due to easier reporting, not actual quality decline. Admins should update documentation and monitor telemetry."
