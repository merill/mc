    "Content": "We are announcing the ability to filter out unwanted rows from your source data directly in Dynamics 365 Customer Insights - Data. This feature reached general availability on October 3, 2025.<br><br>\n<b>How does this affect me? </b><br>\nYou can improve the quality of your unified customer profiles and insights by filtering out unwanted rows from your source data directly. You don't need to filter out unwanted data in downstream processes, and you can apply row filters directly to any source table you ingest, reducing the data scope to just what you need. <br><br>\nKey benefits include:<ul>\n<li><b>Improved processing time: </b>Filtering out unnecessary data like old or obsolete rows can reduce the time required to process the data. Filtering out a significant percentage of unwanted rows can substantially improve performance. </li>\n<li><b>Simplified data configuration: </b>Removing unwanted data at the source eliminates the need to create rules in multiple locations to avoid incorporating the unwanted data. Unification, segments, measures, activities, and predictive insights will use the filtered source data. </li>\n<li><b>Improved data quality: </b>Removing old or obsolete data at the source prevents it from being accidentally included in your results, such as when a new team member creates a segment that includes obsolete data. </li>\n </ul>\n<b>What action do I need to take? </b><br>\nThis message is for awareness, and no action is required.<br><br>\nIf you would like more information on this feature, please visit <a href=\"https://aka.ms/12084/filter-rows-columns-source-data-improved-processing\" target=\"_blank\">Filter rows from source data for better processing</a>.",
