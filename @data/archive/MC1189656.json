    "Content": "<p>Updated November 25, 2025: We have updated the content below to show as intended. Thank you for your feedback.</p><p><b><b>Introduction</b></b>\n</p><p>We’re improving the performance and startup time of calling features in the Microsoft Teams Desktop Client for Windows. To achieve this, we’re introducing a new child process named <i>ms-teams_modulehost.exe</i> that will handle the calling stack separately from the main application process (<i>ms-teams.exe</i>). This change optimizes resource usage and enhances meeting experiences.</p>\n\n<b><b>When this will happen:</b></b>\n<p>Worldwide, GCC, GCC High, and DoD: Rollout will begin early January 2026 and complete by late January 2026.</p><p>Note: Timelines may shift due to year-end feature flag rollout freeze.</p>\n\n<b><b>How this affects your organization:</b></b>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Who is affected:</b> All users running the Teams Desktop Client on Windows.</li>\n<li><b>What will happen:</b>\n<ul>\n<li>A new process (<i>ms-teams_modulehost.exe</i>) will appear in Task Manager under the main Teams process (<i>ms-teams.exe</i>).</li>\n<li>This process is dedicated to calling features and improves performance.</li>\n<li>No changes to user workflows or UI; however, admins should ensure endpoint and security software allow this new process.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n\n<b><b>What you can do to prepare:</b></b>\n<ul>\n<li>Update endpoint management and security software to allowlist <i>ms-teams_modulehost.exe</i> alongside <i>ms-teams.exe</i>.</li>\n<li>Communicate this change to helpdesk staff to avoid confusion during troubleshooting.</li>\n<li>Update internal documentation if you reference Teams process names.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<b><b>Compliance considerations:</b></b>\n<p>No compliance considerations identified, review as appropriate for your organization.</p>\n<p></p>",
