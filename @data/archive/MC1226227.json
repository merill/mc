    "Content": "<p><b><b>Introduction</b></b></p><p>We will introduce a <b>new indicator </b>in <i>Microsoft Teams channels that use the threads layout</i>. As more teams begin using channels to organize their collaboration, we are seeing an increase in simultaneous meetings within the same channel. Today, Teams does not provide an efficient way for channel members to discover all ongoing meetings and choose the one they want to join. This new indicator will help fill that gap by making it easier for users to see active meetings at a glance and quickly join the meeting that best fits their needs.</p><p>The indicator will appear in the <i>channel header </i>and will expand to show active meetings, along with basic details and a <i><b>Join </b></i>button:</p><p><img src=\"https://cxcs.microsoft.net/static/public/messagecenter/neutral/49087c5a-5114-46ab-b99c-e68fbe0edaa3/61c794253ad1d9eacf941724565dba22ddd38156.png\" style=\"width: 400px;\"></p><p>This update is associated with Microsoft 365 Roadmap ID <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?filters=&amp;searchterms=513272#Roadmap\" target=\"_blank\">513272</a>.</p><p><b><b>When this will happen</b></b></p><p><b>Targeted Release (Worldwide): </b>We will begin rolling out in&nbsp;<b>mid-February 2026</b> and expect to complete by late<b> February 2026</b>.</p><p><b>General Availability (Worldwide): </b>We will begin rolling out in&nbsp;<b>early March 2026</b> and expect to complete by <b>mid-March 2026</b>.</p><p><b><b>How this affects your organization</b></b></p><p><i>Who is affected:</i></p><ul><li>Users in <i>Teams channels</i> that use the threads layout</li><li>All Microsoft 365 tenants, including Targeted Release</li></ul><p>What will happen:</p><ul><li>A new ongoing meetings indicator will appear in the <i>channel header</i>.</li><li>Users will be able to expand the indicator to view active meetings.</li><li>Each meeting will show basic details and a <i><b>Join</b></i> button.</li><li>The feature will be&nbsp;<b>on by default</b>; no admin configuration will be required.</li><li>No changes will occur to existing meeting behaviors, policies, or controls.</li></ul><p><b><b>What you can do to prepare</b></b></p><p>No admin action will be required.
