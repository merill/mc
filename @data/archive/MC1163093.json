This feature will reach general availability on October 31, 2025.<br><br> \n\n<b>How does this affect me? </b><br> \n\nThe intent-based transfer routes conversations to the most appropriate user based on the conversation content. This helps to reduce the number of misrouted conversations and decreases average handling time. Administrators can enable Customer Intent Agent and configure intent-based routing in the Copilot Service admin center. <br><br> \n\nCustomer service representatives can utilize intent suggestions to transfer conversations to the most appropriate representative. Service representatives can select from both queues and user groups when initiating the transfer process. By leveraging the intent knowledge base, Copilot can efficiently route conversations to the appropriate user. <br><br> \n\n<b>What action do I need to take? </b><br>  \nThis message is for awareness, and no action is required.",
