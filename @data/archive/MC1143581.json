This feature will reach general availability on September 30, 2025.<br><br> \n\n \n\n<b>How does this affect me? </b><br> \n\nWhen you use the time zone agnostic accounting date field, the voucher date in Finance and Operations is always correct. The date stays accurate no matter the signed-in user's time zone, so project invoicing is always accurate. <br><br> \n\n \n\nWith this feature, Dataverse includes a new time-zone (TZ) agnostic accounting date field. Use this TZ agnostic accounting date field instead of the accounting date field, which uses the user's local time zone, when you post transactions in finance and operations (resource deployments). When this field is enabled, you can use a TZ agnostic accounting date in invoiced transactions so invoicing is accurate. <br><br> \n\n \n\n<b>What action do I need to take? </b><br> \nThis message is for awareness and no action is required.",
