    "Content": "<p><b>Introduction</b></p><p>\nWeâ€™re introducing support for manual uploads of historical HR data in Organizational Data in Microsoft 365. Admins can now specify whether uploaded data is current or historical using a new toggle in the CSV upload experience. For historical data, an effective date can be assigned to ensure accurate processing by downstream apps such as Viva Insights. This enhancement improves data consistency across Microsoft 365 and supports retroactive updates for organizational reporting.</p><p><i>Figure i.
