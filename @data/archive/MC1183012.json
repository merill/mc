    "Content": "<p><b><b>Introduction</b></b></p>\n<p>We’re retiring the ability to create <b>App-V packages</b> for Microsoft 365 Apps starting January 13, 2026. This change aligns with our focus on modern deployment methods and continued investment in <b>Click-to-Run</b>, which offers improved performance, reliability, and supportability.</p>\n<p><b>What is App-V?</b></p>\nMicrosoft Application Virtualization (App-V) is a technology that enables applications to be deployed in a virtualized format, allowing them to run on end-user devices without being installed directly. This helps reduce application conflicts and simplifies management in enterprise environments. While App-V has been useful for certain deployment scenarios, its use for Microsoft 365 Apps has become increasingly uncommon.<p></p>\n\n<p><b><b>When this will happen:</b></b></p>\n<p>This change will take effect on January 13, 2026. After this date, new versions of the Office Deployment Tool will no longer support App-V packaging for Microsoft 365 Apps.</p>\n\n<p><b><b>How this affects your organization:</b></b></p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Who is affected:</b> Organizations that use the Office Deployment Tool in packager mode to create App-V packages for Microsoft 365 Apps.</li>\n<li><b>What will happen:</b>\n  <ul>\n    <li>The Office Deployment Tool will no longer support creation of App-V packages using the /packager argument after January 13, 2026. (Example: setup.exe /packager packageconfig.xml)</li>\n    <li>Existing App-V packages will continue to function, but no new packages can be created using updated tools.</li>\n    <li>Organizations using Click-to-Run are not affected.</li>\n    <li>No changes will occur for organizations that do not use App-V for deployment.</li>\n  </ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><b><b>What you can do to prepare:</b></b></p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Review your deployment strategy before January 13, 2026.</li>\n  <li>Transition to Click-to-Run deployment, which remains fully supported.</li>\n  <li>Update internal documentation and deployment scripts to reflect this change.</li>\n  <li>Communicate this change to IT and helpdesk teams.</li>\n  <li>Learn more about Click-to-Run deployment: <a href=\"https://aka.ms/ODTPackagerDeprecation\" target=\"_blank\">Create an App-V package for Microsoft 365 Apps</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><b><b>Compliance considerations:</b></b></p>\n<p>No compliance considerations identified, review as appropriate for your organization.</p>",
