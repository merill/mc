    "Content": "<p>Updated October 2, 2025: We have updated the timeline. Thank you for your patience.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;<b>Introduction</b></p><p>We're introducing a new behavior in Outlook Mobile that improves draft handling. When users close a draft message in progress, it will now automatically minimize instead of closing completely. This allows users to quickly resume editing via a new button in the message list, enhancing productivity and reducing accidental draft loss.</p><p><b>When this will happen</b></p><p>General Availability (Worldwide, GCC, GCC High, DoD): Rollout will begin in late September 2025 (previously early September) and is expected to complete by late October 2025 (previously early March 2026).</p><p><b>How this affects your organization</b></p><p>Once this change is deployed, users will notice that closing a draft message no longer discards it or hides it from view. Instead, the draft will minimize and remain accessible via a button in the message list. This feature is on by default and does not require user or admin configuration.</p><p>This change is designed to reduce interruptions and improve the user experience by making draft recovery more intuitive.</p><p><b>What you can do to prepare</b></p><p>No admin action is required.</p><p>We recommend the following:</p><ul><li>Inform your users about this change to reduce confusion.</li><li>Update internal documentation or training materials where applicable.</li></ul><p><b>Compliance considerations</b></p><p>No compliance considerations identified, review as appropriate for your organization.</p>",
