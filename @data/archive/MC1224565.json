    "Content": "<p>Updated February 4, 2026: We have updated the timeline. We’ve been notified that some email providers may distrust the DigiCert G1 root on April 15, which could result in broad ecosystem‑wide email impact. To ensure Exchange Online can rotate certificates ahead of this event, customers must trust the DigiCert Global Root G2 certificate authority by March 15 (previously April 30). Thank you for your patience.&nbsp;</p><p><b><b>Introduction</b></b></p><p>Action might be    required to avoid service disruption. To maintain secure and uninterrupted mail flow with Exchange Online, organizations must ensure their servers and clients trust the <b>DigiCert Global Root G2 Certificate Authority (CA)</b> and its subordinate CAs.&nbsp;</p><p>Organizations that rely on custom certificate trust stores, disabled Windows CTL updates, or older runtime environments might be impacted and may need to update their trusted certificate chains.</p>\n\n<p><b><b>When this will happen:</b></b></p><p>\nOrganizations must complete required certificate trust updates <b>before March 15, 2026 (previously April 30)</b>.</p>\n\n<p><b><b>How this affects your organization:</b></b></p><p>\n<b>Who is affected:</b></p>\n\n<p>This change applies to all organizations (Worldwide, GCC, GCC‑High, DoD) that:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Send or receive email with Exchange Online <b>and</b></li>\n  <li>Either:</li>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Your organization has disabled the Windows CTL Updater feature that by default downloads the Certificate Trust List (CTL).\n<ul><li>The CTL contains trusted and untrusted root certificates.
