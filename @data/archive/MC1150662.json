Thank you for your patience.</p><p><b>Introduction</b></p><p>Upcoming privacy-related changes in Chromium-based browsers (Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge) will increase restrictions on local network access. When enforcement begins, users accessing OneDrive for Web (and some integrated Microsoft 365 experiences such as Microsoft Lists and SharePoint Document Libraries) will encounter a browser permission prompt for local network access unless the required policy is in place. If the permission is not allowed, performance optimizations and <a href=\"https://support.microsoft.com/office/work-with-onedrive-web-app-when-offline-05d1865d-8694-4c0a-8e46-28ccb8c58b37\" target=\"_blank\">offline capabilities</a> powered by OneDrive and Share Point will not be available. This communication provides required administrator actions to prevent loss of functionality.</p><p><b>When this will happen:</b></p><p>Chrome and Edge will roll out this privacy related change as part of Chromium 141 at the end of September.</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b></p><p>If no action is taken:</p><p><img src=\"https://cxcs.microsoft.net/static/public/messagecenter/neutral/21ee30ec-4b41-4b77-b7ec-1357c0d6655b/f68733390ed59585964ce46d5e73e73e375a4d0d.png\" style=\"width: 25%;\"><br></p><p>\n</p><ol>\n<li><b>Who is affected:</b><ul><li>All users accessing OneDrive for Web, Microsoft Lists, and SharePoint Document Libraries via Chrome or Edge browsers.</li><li>Admins managing browser policies for Windows, macOS, and VDI environments.</li></ul></li>\n<li><b>What will happen:</b>\n\n<p></p><p>If no action is taken:\n</p><ul><li>Users will see a new browser prompt requesting permission for local network access when opening OneDrive for Web and Lists.</li><li>If users do not click <i>Allow</i>, the following results occur on that device:<ul><li>Performance acceleration will not be available (loss of faster data access behavior).</li><li>Offline functionality in OneDrive Web will not be available.</li></ul></li><li>The experience will be slower and less resilient, and helpdesk contacts will increase due to unexpected prompts and missing offline capability.</li></ul><p>When the recommended browser policy is deployed in advance, the prompt is suppressed for the specified trusted Microsoft 365 endpoints and existing performance, and offline behavior are preserved.
