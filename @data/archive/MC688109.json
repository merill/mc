    "Content": "<p>Updated May 28, 2025: We have updated the timeline below. Thank you for your patience.\n</p><p>Scheduling, setting up, and managing an event is not a simple task. Which is why we allow co-organizer to be added to the event so they can work alongside or on behalf of the organizer. So far co-organizers were able to set up event theming, manage registration, meeting options, view reports and more but were not able to edit event details like title, date/time, description, event group; nor publish or cancel event. Now they can! Co-organizer can edit event details, publish, and cancel the event like the organizer can. So once the co-organizer is added they will have full parity of experience as organizer and control/manage/edit event.&nbsp;</p><p>This message is associated with Microsoft 365 Roadmap ID <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?filters=&amp;searchterms=168524\" target=\"_blank\">168524</a></p><p><b>When this will happen:</b></p><p>Targeted release: We will begin rolling out mid-January 2025 (previously early January) and expect to complete by mid-January 2025 (previously mid-December).</p><p>General Availability (Worldwide, GCC): We will begin rolling out mid-November 2025 (previously mid-January 2025) and expect to complete by late November 2025.
