Business Chat (web) usage is currently limited to Microsoft Edge and Microsoft 365 App, but more apps will be added over time. The Business Chat (work) usage in Edge and Microsoft 365 App was already captured in the report as part of the Business Chat (work) metric, but now we are breaking them out in the adoption by app chart. In the user level table, the last activity dates are added for Business Chat (web), Edge, and Microsoft 365 App.&nbsp;</p><p>\n</p><p>This message is associated with Microsoft 365 Roadmap ID <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?filters=&amp;searchterms=415468\" target=\"_blank\">415468</a>.</p><p><img src=\"https://cxcs.microsoft.net/file/messagecenter/en-us/5a32150b-c4ea-4064-9ac8-a41aeb11d2a9\" style=\"width: 600px;\"></p><p><img src=\"https://cxcs.microsoft.net/file/messagecenter/en-us/767cc171-112c-4f1e-b4e8-246b30fd9fa0\" style=\"width: 600px;\"><br></p><p><b>When this will happen:</b></p><p>General Availability (Worldwide): We will begin rolling out early December 2024 and expect to complete by late December 2024.&nbsp;</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b></p><p>This new usage report is designed help admins understand the overall usage of Business Chat, the split usage between Business Chat (web) and Business Chat (work), and the Business Chat usage in apps Edge and Microsoft 365 App.&nbsp;</p><p>This update is available by default.</p><p>\n</p><p>&nbsp;<b>What you need to do to prepare:</b></p><p>\n</p><p>Due to the new release, Business Chat (work) usage in aggregated tenant exports will be moved to a new file.
