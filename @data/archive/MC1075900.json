Most organizations can quickly set up People Skills using the out-of-the-box skills library. You also have the option to curate your own library by importing custom skills. During the setup, make sure to select the option to allow People Skills in Viva Insights. After these settings are confirmed, it can take a few days for People Skills data to be processed and ingested in Viva Insights.</li><li>To enable People Skills data in one or more of your Viva Insights partitions, make sure your Insights administrator include this dataset when creating or editing a partition. This will become available once public preview starts.\n</li><li>Please make sure Insights analysts and users in your organization are aware of this upcoming change and direct them to the Skills landscape report documentation to learn more about how to use this report.</li></ul><p></p><p><i>Learn more</i></p><ul><li><a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/viva/insights/advanced/analyst/templates/skills-landscape\" target=\"_blank\">Skills landscape report | Microsoft Learn</a></li><li><a href=\"https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2313228&amp;clcid=0x409\" target=\"_blank\">Overview of People Skills | Microsoft Learn</a></li><li>Blog: <a href=\"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/microsoft365copilotblog/announcing-people-skills-general-availability-and-new-skills-agent/4406364\" target=\"_blank\">Announcing People Skills general availability and new Skills agent | Microsoft Community Hub</a></li></ul><p></p>",
