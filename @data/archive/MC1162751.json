This feature will reach general availability on October 31, 2025.<br><br> \n\n<b>How does this affect me?</b><br> \nCustomer Knowledge Management Agent lets you autonomously turn cases and case-related conversations, emails, and notes into knowledge articles that can support your contact center operations. It compares the content of cases against your Dynamics 365 knowledge base to determine if a new article is needed. The agent also ensures that content isn't duplicated and ensures compliance by removing sensitive data (which can be extended with custom automated compliance checks from your organization).<br><br> \n<b>What action do I need to take?</b><br> \nThis message is for awareness and no action is required.<br><br> \nIf you would like more information on this feature, please visit the <a href=\"https://aka.ms/ADO12087b\"target=\"_blank\">Update knowledge base using Customer Knowledge Management Agent</a> article.",
