For example, an organizer who joins the green room from Teams for Windows desktop can access the attendee view from either Teams for the web or Teams for iOS/Android. Also, a select set of town hall features (such as Q&amp;A) will be disabled just for the organizer, co-organizer, or presenter in the attendee experience they are monitoring. This feature has no impact to the broader attendee experience or on organizers, co-organizers, and presenters in the green room.\n</p><p>1. <i>Primary use case:</i> An organizer, co-organizer, or presenter has joined the event and opens the event again in another platform to preview as attendee. They will have a new option to <i>Preview event as attendee</i> below<i> </i>the options to <i>Add this device</i> or <i>Transfer to this device.</i> (Mobile and desktop/web screens shown)\n</p><p><img src=\"https://cxcs.microsoft.net/file/ccp/en-us/3ae6c67f-7b33-4f84-828f-b3d1102d558f\" style=\"width: 400px;\" alt=\"user controls\">\n</p><p>2. <i>Secondary use case:</i> Organizer/Co-Organizer/Presenter has not joined the event as their designated role yet but first chooses to join as attendee.  On desktop and web, they will see a pre-join screen with a new drop-down menu with the option to <i>Preview as attendee. On </i>mobile, they will have the option to <i>Preview as attendee</i> under the <i>More join</i> options.
