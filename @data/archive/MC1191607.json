    "Content": "<p><b><b>Introduction</b></b></p>\n<p>We’re extending the <b>Know Your Customer (KYC)</b> <b>requirements </b>to the Teams Phone porting process in all markets. Teams administrators will need to submit general business information and supporting documents via Teams Admin Center before initiating a port-in request. This one-time process allows Microsoft to validate businesses and fulfill regulatory requirements, helping protect our phone services from misuse, such as spam calls and voice phishing (vishing).</p>\n<p>If your organization has already completed the KYC onboarding (for example, when acquiring new telephone numbers), no further action is required. You will not need to complete the process again and can disregard this message. If you are unsure of the KYC status of your organization, please visit the Know Your Customer page in the Teams Admin Center to verify it and complete it if necessary.</p>\n\n<p><b><b>When this will happen:</b></b></p>\n<p>General Availability (Worldwide, GCC): We will begin rolling out early January 2026 and expect to complete by late January 2026.</p>\n\n<p><b><b>How this affects your organization:</b></b></p>\n<p><b>Who is affected:</b> Teams administrators managing port-in requests for Teams Phone in all markets.</p>\n<p><b>What will happen:</b></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Teams administrators must complete a KYC process in the Teams Admin Center before submitting port-in requests.</li>\n<li>Admins will be required to submit business information and supporting documentation.</li>\n<li>The vetting process typically takes a few hours but may take up to two business days.</li>\n<li>No port-in requests can be processed until the submitted information is validated.</li>\n<li>Existing telephone numbers are not affected.</li>\n<li>These requirements apply globally and are consistent across all Calling Plans markets.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><b><b>What you can do to prepare:</b></b></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Complete the KYC process in advance by visiting the <a href=\"https://admin.teams.microsoft.com/service-configuration/know-your-customer\" target=\"_blank\">Know Your Customer page</a> in the Teams Admin Center.</li>\n<li>Ensure your Teams administrators are ready to provide the following information:</li>\n<ul>\n<li>Business email address</li>\n<li>Company name</li>\n<li>Tax ID, DUNS number, or Business Registration Number</li>\n<li>Business address</li>\n<li>A copy of the Business Registration, Registry Extract, or Articles of Incorporation</li>\n</ul>\n<li>This process applies to all tenants, including those on free trials.
