    "Content": "We are announcing the ability to trigger forecast scenarios on demand in Dynamics 365 Customer Service. This feature will reach general availability on February 27, 2026.<br><br><b>How does this affect me?</b><br>Supervisors will be able to generate up-to-date forecasts during planning and operational reviews without waiting for scheduled runs. This feature allows supervisors to initiate the \"Run forecast scenario\" action, which starts a background job to generate the forecast asynchronously. After the job completes, updated forecast outputs will be available in forecast reports and views. The completion of the forecast run also triggers a capacity planning job to refresh staffing requirements based on the latest forecast output.<br><br><b>What action do I need to take?</b><br> \nTo use this feature, you must install the <i>Workforce Management for Customer Service</i> package from the Power Platform admin center.\n<br><br>If you would like more information on this feature, please visit <a href=\"https://aka.ms/13853/1\"target=\"_blank\">Create and manage forecast scenarios</a>.",
