    "Content": "<p>Updated November 12, 2025: We have added a documentation link. Thank you for your patience.</p><p><b><b>Introduction</b></b></p>\n<p>We’re improving the panel which shows your <b>Activity in other accounts and orgs </b>in Microsoft Teams to streamline how users triage and respond to cross‑tenant activity. This update reduces the need to switch tenants, helping users stay in context and collaborate more efficiently across organizations.</p><p>This message applies to Teams for Windows desktop and Teams for Mac desktop.</p>\n\n<p><b><b>When this will happen:</b></b></p>\n<ul>\n<li><b style=\"\">Targeted Release:</b> Begins rolling out November 16, 2025; expected to complete by November 20, 2025.</li>\n<li><b>General Availability (Worldwide):</b> Begins rolling out late January 2026; expected to complete by late February 2026.</li>\n<li><b>General Availability (GCC, GCC High):</b> Begins rolling out early February 2026; expected to complete by late February 2026.</li>\n<li><b>General Availability (DoD):</b> Begins rolling out mid-February 2026; expected to complete by mid-March 2026.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><b><b>How this affects your organization:</b></b></p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Who is affected:</b> All Microsoft Teams users with multi‑tenant, multi‑account configurations.</li>\n<li><b>What will happen:</b>\n  <ul>\n    <li>Users gain an improved centralized panel for viewing cross‑organization and cross-account activity notifications, eliminating the need to manually switch organizations or accounts to check notification and activity details. This improves responsiveness and reduces context switching.</li>\n    <li>The entry point for the panel that shows <b>Activity in other accounts and orgs</b> will move from the top-right corner to the bottom-left sidebar in Teams. The entry point icon will appear only when you have more than one account or tenant available to you.&nbsp;</li><p><img src=\"https://cxcs.microsoft.net/file/ccp/en-us/4e11fa3e-e014-4b00-ad95-0c7da962b590\" style=\"width: 400px;\" alt=\"user settings\"></p>\n    <li>The entry point icon will display a count of total missed cross‑org and cross‑account activity notifications. </li><li>Selecting the icon will open a panel which will show missed activity notifications across all orgs and accounts, grouped by each tenant. If there is no missed activity in a tenant, it will not appear in the panel.</li>\n    <li>Selecting an activity inside the panel opens it in a child window, preserving the context in the main window.</li>\n    <li>Users can pin up to 3 tenants to the sidebar to stay updated. Pinned tenants remain in the sidebar even if there is no missed activity.</li><li>Selecting a pinned tenant shows a panel with missed activity notifications from that tenant only. Notifications from pinned tenants do not appear in the main panel for activity in other accounts and orgs.</li><p><img src=\"https://cxcs.microsoft.net/file/ccp/en-us/af34c894-090b-4cf4-ac54-1da29e51990e\" style=\"width: 150px;\" alt=\"user settings\"></p>\n    <li>The feature is enabled by default for tenants where multi‑tenant or multi-accounts are supported and available.</li>\n    <li>No admin configuration is required, the updated panel respects existing tenant and account policies.</li></ul></li></ul><p>Review our new documentation here: <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/activity-in-other-accounts-orgs\">Activity in other accounts and orgs - Microsoft Teams | Microsoft Learn</a>.</p><p><b><b>What you can do to prepare:</b></b></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Communicate this change to users, including the new location of the <b>Activity in other accounts and orgs panel</b> and the ability to pin tenants to the sidebar.</li>\n<li>Monitor adoption and gather feedback for future iterations.</li>\n<li>No admin action is required for rollout.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><b>Known issue:</b> Cross-cloud notifications do not appear in the <b>Activity in other accounts and orgs panel</b> at this time. This capability is actively being worked on and is expected to be available by the end of November 2025.</p>\n\n<p><b><b>Compliance considerations:</b></b></p>\n<p>No compliance considerations identified, review as appropriate for your organization.</p>",
