Thank you for your patience.&nbsp;</p><p><b><b>Introduction</b></b></p>\nWe are excited to announce the upcoming rollout of <b>Microsoft 365 Copilot Chat Adoption Metrics in Microsoft Copilot Dashboard</b> to tenants that have at least one Microsoft 365 Copilot license assigned. This feature has been previously released to tenants that have at least 50 assigned Viva Insights licenses, or 50 assigned Microsoft 365 Copilot licenses.<p></p>\n\n<p>This feature empowers organizations with powerful insights into the adoption and usage of M365 Copilot Chat by users who are not licensed for M365 Copilot. Insights include usage trends, retention and usage intensity insights, app-level breakdowns, and filtering by organizational attributes.</p><p>This experience will be enabled by default for tenants with at least 1 M365 Copilot license. You can disable insights for Copilot Chat (unlicensed) in Viva Feature Access Management, either at user- or tenant-level.</p><p>Screenshot: <i>Copilot chat adoption in Copilot Dashboard</i></p><p><img src=\"https://cxcs.microsoft.net/file/ccp/en-us/b98840da-d87c-4786-8247-218c7ea26232\" style=\"width: 400px;\" alt=\"user settings\"></p><p>This message is associated with Roadmap ID&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?filters=&amp;searchterms=501581\" target=\"_blank\">501581</a>.</p>\n\n<p><b><b>When this will happen:</b></b></p>\n<p>General Availability (Worldwide):\nWe will begin rolling out in early March 2026 (previously mid-February) and expect to complete by late March 2026 (previously late February).</p>\n\n<p><b><b>How this affects your organization:</b></b></p>\n<p><b>Who is affected:</b></p><ul><li>Tenants with at least one Microsoft 365 Copilot license assigned.</li><li>Admins and users enabled for Microsoft Copilot Dashboard.</li></ul>\n\n<p><b style=\"\">For tenants with 1-49 paid licenses: </b></p><p>For tenants with at 1-49 M365 Copilot licenses the user experience for the M365 Copilot adoption and impact insights will also update and include organizational filters and group by attributes.
