When you delete the event, the community feed will remain unimpacted. It can be made available to the community feed if a user explicitly shares a conversation from the event feed to the community feed.&nbsp;</p><p>It is important to note that this change will only be available for newly created events &amp; will not apply to past events. Existing events that were created before this release in the community will still show messages in the community feed. When you delete those events, the messages will remain in the community feed.</p><p><b>What do you need to do to prepare:</b></p><p>This change will be available by default and doesn’t require any changes at your end.</p>",
