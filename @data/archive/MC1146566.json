This feature will reach general availability on October 1, 2025.<br><br><b>How does this affect me?</b><br>From a grid page, users can select the 'Visualize' button at the top of the page and Copilot will generate a chart in a new pane on the page. From there, users can change the chart type, the columns that are displayed, or both. Copilot will actively regenerate the chart as users add or remove columns, and refresh data within the chart if filters are applied or removed. Once generated, users can also save the chart from the ellipsis menu at the top of the pane.<br><br>Additionally, users will also be able to use natural language prompts in the Copilot bar on the grid page to generate these charts.<br><br><b>What action do I need to take?</b><br>This message is for awareness, and no action is required.<br><br>If you would like more information on this feature, please visit <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://aka.ms/ADO11722\">Visualize data in a view with Copilot</a>.",
