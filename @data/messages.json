This helps organizations meet compliance requirements without compromising email delivery performance.</p><p>This message is associated with Microsoft 365 Roadmap ID <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?filters=&amp;searchterms=410245\" target=\"_blank\">410245</a>.</p><p><b>When this will happen:</b></p><p>Public Preview: We will begin rolling out in early August 2025 and expect to complete by end of August 2025.</p><p>General Availability (Worldwide): We expect to begin rolling out in early October 2025 and expect to complete by late October 2025.</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b></p><p>In-Region Routing (IRR) is disabled by default. If you do not plan to use this feature, no action is required.</p><p>For domains where you choose to enable IRR, the feature allows you to route inbound emails to accepted domains associated with specific geo-regions. When these domains are aligned with users located in the same geo-region, emails are fully processed and stored within the recipient’s region. This ensures that data remains within the user’s Preferred Data Location (PDL), supporting stronger data sovereignty and compliance with regional regulations.</p><p>If your organization uses Microsoft Purview capabilities such as Data Loss Prevention (DLP), retention policies, or eDiscovery, you may need to review and adjust those policies to ensure they align with the new regional routing behavior.</p><p></p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b></p><ul><li>Ensure that admins have the necessary permissions to manage accepted domains and access to either Exchange Online PowerShell or to the Microsoft 365 admin center.</li><li>Review your domain configurations and identify users located in secondary geo-regions.\n</li><li>Prepare to configure accepted domains with the new geo-region property.</li><li>Review the documentation for configuring the feature: <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/enterprise/microsoft-365-multi-geo?view=o365-worldwide\" target=\"_blank\">Microsoft 365 Multi-Geo | Learn</a>&nbsp;</li></ul><p>We value your feedback and want to hear from you if you have any questions or concerns. Please comment or contact us through the M365 Admin Center if you need any assistance.</p><p><b>Compliance considerations:</b></p><ul><li>Does the change alter how existing user data is processed, stored, or accessed? - Yes. Emails are stored in-region based on domain configuration.</li><li>Does the change modify, interrupt, or disable any Purview capabilities? - Maybe. Depends on how DLP or retention policies are scoped by region.</li><li>Does the change alter how admins can monitor, report on, or demonstrate compliance activities? - Maybe. Regional routing may affect reporting granularity.</li></ul><p></p><p></p>",

Copilot will now process and access additional types of existing data—specifically, discussion posts from public Viva Engage communities and Storylines—as grounding sources for responses. This expands the scope of data used by Copilot, though it does not change where or how the data is stored.</li><li>Does the change introduce or significantly modify AI/ML or agent capabilities that interact with or provide access to customer data? - Yes. This change enhances Copilot’s AI capabilities by expanding the types of content it can use to generate responses. It introduces new grounding sources (discussion posts), which may affect the relevance and scope of AI-generated answers.</li><li>Does the change provide users any new way of interacting with generative AI? - Yes. Users may now receive Copilot responses grounded in a broader set of Viva Engage content, which may change the type and depth of information surfaced in their queries. However, the interaction model (such as chat with Copilot) remains the same.</li></ul><p><br></p><p><br></p>",

At the tenant level, the corresponding settings <i>Configure workspace level inbound network rules</i> and <i>Configure workspace level outbound network rules</i> will be in the Advanced networking section of the Fabric admin portal.The new tenant-level settings will be disabled by default. You (the tenant admin) can switch ON the tenant toggle in the Fabric admin center if you decide to make this feature available to your workspace admins. This will allow the workspace admins to configure Workspace-level private links and Outbound access protection.

During Preview, admins can block inbound public access with the public REST API, which does not require a workspace-level private link set up in Azure.

When used with other networking features in Fabric, the <i>Outbound access protection</i> feature can help secure your data from exfiltration.  Workspace admins will be able to block all the outbound connectivity from the workspace. Once enabled, all outbound connections made by Fabric Spark artifacts from this workspace will be blocked. The only way to enable a connection is by first establishing a managed private endpoint (MPE) from the workspace to the destination.

      "Content": "<p>Updated July 3, 2025: We have updated the timeline below. Thank you for your patience.</p><p>Microsoft Purview Insider Risk Management (IRM) will be adding a new role--Data Security Investigation Contributor--to the Insider Risk Management Investigators role group. This will allow members of the Insider Risk Management Investigators role group to launch   a Data Security Investigation (DSI) from an IRM case. \n</p><p>DSI is a new AI-powered solution that enables data security teams to identify incident-related data, conduct deep content analysis, and mitigate risk within one unified solution. DSI enables data security admins to efficiently identify incident-relevant content by searching their Microsoft 365 data estate to locate emails, Teams messages, Copilot prompts and responses, and documents. Once the investigation is scoped, DSI’s generative AI capabilities allow admins to gain deeper insights into the impacted data, revealing critical security risks and sensitive information. Investigative capabilities include the ability to categorize evidence, perform vector searches, and examine impacted data for security and sensitive data risks. DSI visualizes correlations between investigation data, users, and their activities. To mitigate identified risks, DSI facilitates secure collaboration between partner teams. Post-investigation learnings can be used to refine existing policies to strengthen an organization's security practices.  \n</p><p>The integration between IRM and DSI allows an IRM investigator to identify when a risky user needs deeper investigation to launch a pre-scoped investigation directly from the user activity pane, allowing them to view content analysis related to that user and better assess post-incident data impact.  \n</p><p>This message is associated with roadmap ID  <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?rtc=1%26filters%3D&amp;searchterms=485707\" target=\"_blank\">485707</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>\n</p><p><b>When this will happen:</b>\n</p><p>Public Preview (Worldwide): We will begin rolling out early April 2025 and expect to complete by late April 2025.</p><p>General Availability (Worldwide): We will begin rolling out in mid-July 2025 (previously mid-June) and expect to complete by mid-August 2025 (previously mid-July).</p><p> \n</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b> \n</p><p>With this update, members of the Insider Risk Management Investigators role group will be able to create Data Security Investigations from an Insider Risk Management case. Members of the Insider Risk Management Investigators role group will not be able to view the Data Security Investigation unless they are assigned the Data Security Investigation Investigator role.</p><p>\n</p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b> \n</p><p>This rollout will happen automatically by the specified date with no admin action required before the rollout. Review your current configuration to determine the impact for your organization.

We will provide a subsequent update by the end of May 2025 (previously end of March) with an updated timeline for tenants that are opted out.</p><p>We're going to start gradually dropping messages that have multiple From addresses (also known as P2 From headers) without a Sender header from being processed via Exchange Online, please review the section \"When this will happen\" for rollout timeline information for your tenant.</p><p>If we see significant traffic exhibiting multiple From addresses (P2 From headers) without a Sender header in your tenant in the month of September, we will send you a Message Center Post by October 15th alerting you and providing some sample message IDs.</p><p>We are doing this to comply with <a href=\"https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5322#section-3.6.2\" target=\"_blank\">RFC 5322 (https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5322#section-3.6.2)</a>&nbsp;which mandates the Sender header to be present and contain a single address if the From header has more than one address. Noncompliance with this could be exploited by attackers, allowing them to impersonate a sender address by misleading the client into using the From header to determine the sender instead of the Sender header.\n</p><p><b>When this will happen:</b></p><p>General Availability (Worldwide, GCC): We will begin rolling out April 15, 2025, and expect to complete by May 15, 2025.</p><p>GCC High, DOD: We will begin rolling out October 7, 2025 (previously July 1), and expect to complete by November 1, 2025 (previously August 1).</p><p>We are delaying the rollout start date in order to provide more time to customers for investigating messages exhibiting multiple P2 From Addresses without a Sender Address.&nbsp;</p><p>Most of the traffic exhibiting multiple P2 From Addresses without a Sender Address will be inbound spam destined for your tenant sent by malicious spammers on the internet.\n</p><p>Some customers are sending legitimate emails with this malformed header configuration. On October 15, we sent a targeted MC post to customers showing high volumes of messages exhibiting multiple P2 From Addresses without a Sender Address as they may be impacted by this change.\n</p><p>For investigating if you will be impacted by this change, focus your investigation on messages sent using On Premises Inbound Connectors to Exchange Online. Authenticated mail submission is not impacted because submitting messages like this using those submissions are not allowed (Graph, Outlook clients, SMTP AUTH Client Submission).</p><p><b>How this affects your organization:</b>\n</p><p>If email clients including devices and applications that you use to send messages, do so using multiple From addresses but without a Sender address header after the change starts rolling out to your environment, you will get an NDR error code 550 5.1.20 “Multiple From addresses are not allowed without Sender address.</p><p><b>What you can do to prepare:</b>\n</p><p>When this change is in effect, if you need to send a message that has more than one email address in the From field, make sure that you have a single email address in the Sender header.\n</p><p>If you expect this change to cause any issues for your organization, please share that feedback.\n</p>",

      "Content": "<p>Updated June 27, 2025: We have updated the timeline below. Thank you for your patience.</p><p>We have introduced a new configuration option in Microsoft Purview called collection policies for targeted signal discovery and collection. Collection policies will allow administrators to fine tune the signals and data collected for Purview solutions at the tenant level. This includes specifying which Sensitive Information Types (SITs) are classified and what activities are collected on Windows endpoint devices.\n</p><p>This message is associated with Microsoft 365 Roadmap ID <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?filters=&amp;searchterms=479760\" target=\"_blank\">479760</a>.\n</p><p><b>When this will happen:</b>\n</p><p>Public Preview: Available now.</p><p>General Availability (Worldwide): We will begin rolling out late June 2025 (previously early June) and expect to complete by mid-July 2025 (previously late June).\n</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b>\n</p><p><i>Key benefits of collection policies</i></p><ul><li>Granular control: Align with regulatory, regional, and organizational requirements that specify what types of data can be collected. \n</li><li>Noise reduction: Focus on the most relevant data security risks by tailoring data discovery and signals to what’s important for your organization \n</li></ul><p><i>Purview solutions impacted \n</i></p><ul><li>Unlike traditional Purview Data Loss Prevention (DLP) or Microsoft Purview Information Protection policies, collection policies are designed to streamline discovery of relevant information, rather than apply enforcement or take action on that information. There is no action taken from these policies to block content, as policies are meant to scope what content is collected and surfaces to administrators.</li><li>Using collection policies to scope signal collection will impact what is surfaced in several Purview solutions, including Insider Risk Management (IRM), Data Security Posture Management (DSPM), eDiscovery, Data Lifecycle Management (DLM), Activity Explorer, and more. Learn more: <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/purview/collection-policies-solution-overview\" target=\"_blank\">Collection Policies Solution Overview (preview) | Microsoft Learn</a></li></ul><p>There is no immediate impact of this feature release. If you choose to leverage collection policies, admins can now choose which signals to discover in devices.\n</p><p>After you enable collection policies, you may see various updates to the Purview DLP audit experience. These updates may affect your organizations current configuration in the following ways: \n</p><ul><li>Activities to audit on your tenant will be scoped to the selected SITs and user activities \n</li><li>A new Location picker experience will be used to scope users and groups \n</li><li>To use collection policies for endpoints, the DLP <i>Always audit </i>setting will still need to be enabled. However, once created, collection policies for endpoint devices adjust from an open policy to an allowlisting policy that supports inclusion and/or exclusion of specific users, groups, and specified activities to reduce load and address customer requirements. \n</li></ul><p>This feature is available by default for admins to configure.</p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b>\n</p><p>There is no immediate impact of this feature release until you create an initial collection policy and <i>Always audit</i> is enabled in DLP (Windows endpoint devices only). To prepare for this upcoming enhancement to the Purview portal, we recommend you:</p><ul><li>Review Microsoft Learn docs on collection policies and required prerequisites: <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/purview/collection-policies-solution-overview\" target=\"_blank\">Collection Policies Solution Oerview (preview) | Microsoft Learn</a></li><li>Help inform other Purview admins whose signal collection would be scoped, including the solutions in this message. \n</li></ul><p>This rollout will happen automatically by the specified dates with no admin action required before the rollout. Review your current configuration to assess the impact on your organization. You may want to notify your users about this change and update any relevant documentation.</p>",

      "Content": "<p>We’ve made several usability improvements to enhance live captions and live transcripts in Microsoft Teams — making meetings more intuitive, less distracting, and more privacy-conscious.\n</p><p>First, live captions will be scrollable, allowing users to review the meeting conversation without interrupting the live view. To help protect sensitive content and support compliance with data handling policies, copying text from live captions is now disabled by default. This ensures captions remain a real-time experience, reducing the risk of content being copied and shared out of context.\n</p><p>Second, the <i>Live transcript</i> panel will no longer open automatically for the user who starts recording, which also triggers transcription in the background. Before this rollout, this panel only auto-opens for the person who initiates recording or transcription — not for other participants — but this can be distracting and isn’t always relevant to the user's intent. After this rollout, the <i>Live transcript</i> panel will remain closed unless manually opened or the user explicitly starts transcription. This gives users more control over their meeting layout and helps avoid unnecessary screen changes during important discussions.\n</p><p>Third, when transcription is enabled, users who attempt to open the<i> Live transcript</i> panel will now see a banner suggesting they switch to live captions instead. This helps guide users to the most appropriate feature for following the conversation in real time, improving comprehension and reducing confusion.</p><p>\n</p><p>This message applies to Teams for Windows desktop, Teams for Mac desktop, and Teams for the web. </p><p>This message is associated with Microsoft 365 Roadmap ID <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?filters=&amp;searchterms=495454\" target=\"_blank\">495454</a>.</p><p><b>When this will happen:</b></p><p>Targeted Release: We will begin rolling out early July 2025 and expect to complete by mid-July 2025.</p><p>General Availability (Worldwide, GCC): We will begin rolling out mid-July 2025 and expect to complete by late July 2025.</p><p>General Availability (GCC High): We will begin rolling out late July 2025 and expect to complete by early August 2025.</p><p>General Availability (DoD): We will begin rolling out early August 2025 and expect to complete by mid-August 2025.</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b></p><p>These updates improve usability, privacy, and accessibility in Teams meetings.

Before this rollout, admin changes made in the Integrated apps section of the Microsoft 365 admin center would only affect these Teams apps in Outlook and the Microsoft 365 app. Similarly, changes made in the Teams admin center would exclusively affect Teams. Starting in June 2024, we will roll out Unified App Management to streamline the management of these apps across Teams, Outlook and the Microsoft 365 App, so they are consistently available across all supported clients.</p><p>This message is associated with Microsoft 365 Roadmap ID <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?filters=&amp;searchterms=393931\" target=\"_blank\">393931</a>.\n</p><p><b>When this will happen:</b>\n</p><p>This rollout will happen in two major phases.

This phase applies to tenants with no modified settings in either the Microsoft 365 admin center (Integrated apps) or the Teams admin center for organization-wide defaults, app deployment, app availability, or block/unblock. No merge rules apply to these tenants, but after this phase, any app management setting configured in either admin centers will apply to all relevant hosts. \n</li><li>Phase 2: We will update this post with a timeline and more details in May 2025 (previously April 2025).&nbsp; This phase is applicable to tenants with app settings that have differences between Microsoft 365 admin center (Integrated apps) and Teams admin center.</li></ul><p>\n</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b>\n</p><p>Before this rollout, managing Teams apps that work in Outlook and the Microsoft 365 app was fragmented between the <i>Integrated app</i>s page in the Microsoft 365 admin center for Outlook and the Microsoft 365 app, and the Teams admin center for Teams. This sometimes resulted in different settings for the same app in the two admin centers. With Unified App Management, we will be consolidating app catalog management into a single platform. You will be able to manage apps on the <i>Integrated apps</i> page in the Microsoft 365 admin center or in the Teams admin center, and any changes made in either admin center will synchronize.\n</p><p><i>What you can expect</i>\n</p><ol><li>App catalog enhancements: Apps will start showing hosts where they are available: Teams, Outlook, or the Microsoft 365 app. \n</li><li>Organization-wide settings: App availability default settings will now apply to apps used in Teams, Outlook, and Microsoft 365 app.\n</li><li>App installs: Apps deployed from the Integrated apps page in Microsoft 365 admin center will be preinstalled in all applicable hosts for the app. Unlike app preinstallation in the Teams App setup policy, new app installs will provide access to the preinstalled apps, similar to deploying the app for Outlook and the Microsoft 365 App. <b>For more details on app deployment, refer to MC795355&nbsp;<i>Microsoft Teams admin center: App centric management for app installation and changes to app setup policies</i> (May 2024)</b>.</li><li>App availability: Managing app availability will apply to all applicable app hosts. \n</li><li>App block/unblock: Blocking or unblocking apps will apply to all applicable app hosts. \n</li><li>Consolidation of existing app settings: All existing app settings will be unified between Integrated apps (MAC) and Manage apps (TAC) pages. Merge rules can be found in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/MicrosoftTeams/manage-apps-across-m365\" target=\"_blank\">Manage apps that work across Teams, Outlook, and Microsoft 365 | Microsoft Learn</a>.

Thank you for your patience.</p><p style=\"margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:7.5pt;margin-left:0in\"><b>Important update regarding the cloud hosted Mailbox External Recipient Rate Limit:</b>  In order to reduce the impact on customers, Microsoft has again decided to delay the rollout of the cloud hosted Mailbox External Recipient Rate Limit (MERRL) by ~six months. The MERRL will go into enforcement in April 2026 for trial tenants and new tenants if the tenant is provisioned on/after April 1st, 2026. In April 2026, the Exchange Admin Center Report will be available for tenant admins to review Sender mailbox data on external recipient volume. In October 2026, the MERRL will go into enforcement for all cloud hosted mailboxes in the WWMT environment including existing tenants.</p><p style=\"margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:7.5pt;margin-left:0in\">Please refer to the ACS email documentation (Prepare an email communication resource for Azure Communication Services - An Azure Communication Services concept article | Microsoft Learn) or reach out to your Microsoft account team for further support in this journey.</p><p style=\"margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:7.5pt;margin-left:0in\"><b>Please note:</b> We have made the decision to not proceed with this change for DoD, GCC, or GCC High organizations at this time. We will communicate via Message center when we are ready to proceed. The External Recipient Rate Limit will only apply to WWMT/Production.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:7.5pt;margin-left:0in\">Please refer to the ACS email documentation (Prepare an email communication resource for Azure Communication Services - An Azure Communication Services concept article | Microsoft Learn) or reach out to your Microsoft account team for further support in this journey.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:7.5pt;margin-left:0in\"> ________________________________________\n</p><p style=\"margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:7.5pt;margin-left:0in\"><br></p><p style=\"margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:7.5pt;margin-left:0in\">Today, we are announcing that, beginning in April 2026 (previously October 2025), Exchange Online will begin enforcing an external recipient rate limit of 2000 recipients in 24 hours.</p><p>Exchange Online does not support bulk or high-volume transactional email. We have not enforced limiting of bulk email until now, but we plan on doing so with the introduction of an External Recipient Rate (ERR) limit. The ERR limit is being introduced to help reduce unfair usage and abuse of Exchange Online resources. </p><p><b>When this will happen:</b></p><p>The new ERR limit will be introduced in 2 phases:</p><p>Phase 1 - Starting April 1, 2026, (previously October 2025) the limit will apply to cloud-hosted mailboxes of trial tenants and all tenants created after this date.&nbsp;</p><p>Phase 2 – Starting October 1, 2026, (previously April 2026) we will start applying the limit to cloud-hosted mailboxes of existing tenants.&nbsp;</p><p> <b>How this will affect your organization:</b></p><p>Exchange Online enforces a Recipient Rate limit of 10000 recipients for cloud-hosted mailboxes. The 2000 ERR limit will become a sublimit within this 10000 Recipient Rate limit. There is no change to the Recipient Rate limit, and both of these will be rolling limits for 24-hour windows. You can send to up to 2,000 external recipients in a 24-hour period, and if you max out the external recipient rate limit then you will still be able to send to up to 8,000 internal recipients in that same period. If you don't send to any external recipients in a 24-hour period, you can send to up to 10,000 internal recipients.</p><p>For example:\n</p><ul><li>You use a cloud-hosted mailbox to send to 1,000 external recipients and 2,000 internal recipients at 6:00AM on Day 1, for a total of 3,000 recipients. You then send to another 1,000 external recipients at 8:00AM on Day 1. Because you sent to 2,000 external recipients, you will be blocked from sending to external recipients until 6:00AM on Day 2. During this period, you are able to send to up to 6,000 internal recipients, but for this example, let's assume that you don't.\n</li><li>At 6:00AM on Day 2, the 1,000 external recipients and 2,000 internal recipients sent at 6:00AM on Day 1 will no longer count toward the 24-hour limit calculation. Thus, from 6:00-8:00AM on Day 2, you can send to up to 9,000 total recipients (e.g., 9,000 internal or 8,000 internal plus 1,000 external).\n</li><li>If you don't send to any internal or external recipients during this period, then at 8:00AM on Day 2 you can again send to 10,000 recipients total with up to 2,000 of them being external recipients.</li></ul><p>\n</p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b><br></p><p>If you have a cloud-hosted mailbox that needs to exceed the ERR limit, you can move to <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/communication-services/concepts/email/email-overview\" target=\"_blank\">Azure Communication Services for Email</a>, which is designed specifically for high volume email sent to recipients external to your tenant.</p>",

While no longer widely used, Legacy protocols such as FPRPC can be more susceptible to compromise and blocking FPRPC helps reduce exposure to vulnerabilities.

It is an advanced method of sending messages to your users and requires proper configuration of SPF, DKIM, and DMARC to ensure messages are delivered successfully.</p><p>Many customers do not need to use Direct Send. Because SPF protections do not always outright block messages and sometimes deliver them to the Junk folder, it is possible for malicious senders mimicking Direct Send to have their messages that spoof your own domains land in the Junk folder and potentially confuse your users. Before this rollout, no feature existed to block Direct Send traffic for customers who have no need to use it. We will roll out the new <i>Reject Direct Send</i> setting for Exchange Online.</p><p><b>When this will happen:</b>\n</p><p>Public Preview: Available now.</p><p>General Availability (Worldwide, GCC, GCC High): We will begin rolling out early September 2025 and expect to complete by early September 2025.</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b></p><p>Direct Send covers anonymous messages sent from your own domain to your organization’s mailboxes and so enabling this setting will block any of that traffic. Direct Send traffic may include third-party services that you have given permission to use your domain or one of your own email applications hosted on-premises. To avoid having these messages rejected when this feature is enabled, they need to be authenticated. You can authenticate them by creating a <i>partner mail flow connector</i> for these messages.    \n</p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b>\n</p><p>This rollout has happened automatically by the specified dates with no admin action required before the rollout. Review your current configuration to assess the impact on your organization. You may want to notify your users about this change and update your relevant documentation.\n</p><p>By default, the new opt-in <code>RejectDirectSend</code> setting is set to <code>False</code>.  To enable the Reject Direct Send feature, Exchange Online admins can run this Microsoft PowerShell cmdlet: \n</p><p><code>Set-OrganizationConfig -RejectDirectSend $true</code>\n</p><p>The change should propagate out to your entire service within 30 minutes. With the feature enabled, any received Direct Send messages will see the following message:  \n</p><p><code>550 5.7.68 TenantInboundAttribution; Direct Send not allowed for this organization from unauthorized sources</code> \n</p><p>Unless you re-enable Direct Send, any messages that hit this error will need a partner connector created to authenticate their source as an approved sender.  \n</p><p>Learn more: <a href=\"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/exchange/introducing-more-control-over-direct-send-in-exchange-online/4408790\" target=\"_blank\">Introducing more control over Direct Send in Exchange Online | Microsoft Community Hub</a></p><p>We invite Exchange admins to try out the feature and provide feedback that we can use to validate and proceed to offering this feature for General Availability.</p>",

Please review the information below for more details.\n</p><p>Updated October 18, 2024: We have updated the SMTP AUTH Clients Submission Report in the Exchange admin center, adding the Authentication Protocol column to show if Basic auth or OAuth is being used to submit email to Exchange Online. The data will build up over the next 90 days. Thank you for your patience.\n</p><p>Today, we are announcing that Exchange Online will permanently remove support for Basic authentication with Client Submission (SMTP AUTH) gradually beginning with a small percentage of submission rejections for all tenants on March 1st 2026 and reaching 100% rejections on April 30th 2026, (previously September 2025). After this time, applications and devices will no longer be able to use Basic auth as an authentication method and must use OAuth when using SMTP AUTH to send email.\n</p><p>Basic auth is a legacy authentication method that sends usernames and passwords in plain text over the network. This makes it vulnerable to credential theft, phishing, and brute force attacks. To improve the protection of our customers and their data, we are retiring Basic auth from Client Submission (SMTP AUTH) and encouraging customers to use modern authentication methods that are more secure.\n</p><p><b>When this will happen:</b>\n</p><p>We will be making this change beginning March 1st, 2026, and completing April 30th, 2026 (previously September 2025).\n</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b>\n</p><p>The SMTP AUTH Clients Submission Report in the Exchange admin center has been updated to show if Basic auth or OAuth is being used to submit email to Exchange Online. Starting in July 2025, we will send monthly Message Center posts to tenants who are using Basic auth with Client Submission (SMTP AUTH) to alert them to the upcoming change.\n</p><p>Starting March 1st 2026 (previously September 2025) we will gradually start rejecting Basic Auth requests to the Client Submission (SMTP AUTH) endpoints, increasing to 100% rejection by the end of the April 2026. \n</p><p>The Client Submission (SMTP AUTH) endpoints in scope for this change are:\n</p><p>•\tsmtp.office365.com\n</p><p>•\tsmtp-legacy.office365.com\n</p><p>Once Basic auth is permanently disabled, any clients or apps connecting using Basic auth with Client Submission (SMTP AUTH) will receive this response:\n</p><p>•\t550 5.7.30 Basic authentication is not supported for Client Submission.\n</p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b>\n</p><p>If your client supports OAuth, follow these steps: <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/exchange/client-developer/legacy-protocols/how-to-authenticate-an-imap-pop-smtp-application-by-using-oauth\" target=\"_blank\">Authenticate an IMAP, POP or SMTP connection using OAuth</a>\n</p><p>If your client doesn’t support OAuth and you must use Basic Auth with Client Submission (SMTP AUTH), you will need to switch to one of the following alternatives before April 2026, previously September 2025:\n</p><p>•\tIf you are using basic authentication with Client Submission (SMTP AUTH) to send emails to recipients internal to your tenant, you can use Microsoft 365 High Volume Email. Please visit this site to learn more: <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/Exchange/mail-flow-best-practices/high-volume-mails-m365\" target=\"_blank\">Manage high volume emails for Microsoft 365 Public preview</a>\n</p><p>•\tIf you are using basic authentication with Client Submission (SMTP AUTH) to send emails to recipients internal and external to your tenant, you can use Azure Communication Services Email. Please visit this site to learn more: <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/communication-services/concepts/email/email-overview\" target=\"_blank\">Overview of Azure Communication Services email</a>\n</p><p>•\tIf you have an Exchange Server on-premises in a hybrid configuration, you can use Basic auth to authenticate with the Exchange Server on-premises or configure the Exchange Server on-premises with a Receive connector that allows anonymous relay on Exchange servers. Please visit this site to learn more: <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/exchange/mail-flow/connectors/allow-anonymous-relay?view=exchserver-2019\" target=\"_blank\">Allow anonymous relay on Exchange servers</a>\n</p><p>Regardless of the volume of email, if you must use Basic auth to send email with Exchange Online, then you must use one of the alternatives or a 3P solution.\n</p><p>We understand that this change requires some adjustments, but we believe that this is a necessary step to enhance the security and reliability of our email service and your data.\n</p><p><br></p>",

DSI enables data security admins to efficiently identify incident-relevant content by searching their Microsoft 365 data estate to locate emails, Teams messages, Copilot prompts and responses, and documents. Once the investigation is scoped, DSI’s generative AI capabilities allow admins to gain deeper insights into the impacted data, revealing critical security risks and sensitive information. Investigative capabilities include the ability to categorize evidence, perform vector searches, and examine impacted data for security and sensitive data risks.

      "Content": "<p>Updated June 6, 2025: Enforcement actions on unlicensed OneDrive accounts are ongoing. Please continue to monitor your <a href=\"http://spo.ms/admin#/oneDriveAccounts/management\" target=\"_blank\">Unlicensed OneDrive Account report</a>, as all accounts listed will be subject to enforcement if no action is taken.  To support more informed decision-making, we’ve introduced new and more granular reasons for why an account may appear unlicensed but and has not been deleted. This added detail should help you take the appropriate actions for each case and will be available in your Unlicensed OneDrive Accounts report no later than June 24th.  In some cases, admin action is required to delete the accounts. The timeline for enforcement remains unchanged from our last update.</p><p>Enforcement began on January 27, 2025. The rollout has slowed to ensure a safe roll-out with sufficient time for admins to adjust. Admins should anticipate that it takes time for all unlicensed accounts to complete the enforcement process. The initial enforcement rollout will be complete by October 29, 2025.</p><p><b>Timeline for accounts unlicensed before July 28, 2025\n</b></p><ul><li>September 26, 2025: By this date, all unlicensed accounts transition to read-only mode. Admins are advised to check after this date. Checking earlier can result in an incomplete status snapshot.\n</li><li>October 29, 2025: By this date, all unlicensed accounts are archived. Admins are advised to check after this date. Checking earlier can result in an incomplete status snapshot.</li></ul><p><b>Timeline for accounts unlicensed after July 28, 2025</b></p><ul><li>For accounts unlicensed after July 28, 2025, the account will be put into read-only mode on the 60th unlicensed day, and will be archived or moved to the recycle bin on the 93rd unlicensed day.\n</li></ul><p><b>Example:\n</b></p><ul><li>Unlicensed Date: October 1, 2025\n</li><li>Day 60: Nov 30, 2025. The account is placed in read-only mode. </li><li>Day 93: January 2, 2026: The account is archived. If the user is still active in Entra ID but the admin hasn't enabled billing, then this is also the date on which the account will begin the deprovisioning process.</li><li>Admins are encouraged to monitor account statuses based on these timelines to ensure compliance and take any necessary actions.</li></ul><p><b>When will this happen:</b> \n</p><p>&nbsp;General Availability (Worldwide): We began rolling out late January 2025 and expect to complete by late October 2025 (previously late March).</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization</b>\n</p><p>After this storage policy goes into effect in your tenant, any OneDrive user accounts that have been unlicensed for more than 93 days will be archived automatically and will become inaccessible to end users. Admins can view these accounts with admin tools, but the accounts will not be accessible to users until admins take action on them. For example, a OneDrive account that became unlicensed on August 1, 2025 will be inaccessible to users as of October 1, 2025.</p><p>As an admin, you can view a list of unlicensed accounts in your tenant by navigating to SharePoint admin center &gt; <i>Reports &gt; OneDrive accounts</i>. Some admins will have access to this page as soon as July 26, 2024, but most admins will be able to access the page closer to August 16, 2024.\n</p><ul><li>Set up the Archive billing for unlicensed accounts to be able to access and edit the archived files.\n</li><li>Delete the unlicensed OneDrive account, if it does not have a retention policy applied to it. \n</li><li>Renew the unlicensed account to maintain access.\n</li></ul><p></p><p>The <i>Unlicensed OneDrive accounts</i> page that will be in Microsoft admin center:\n</p><p><img src=\"https://cxcs.microsoft.net/file/messagecenter/en-us/8f5c65a0-5515-49e1-b876-07e81c69a89a\" style=\"width: 400px;\" alt=\"admin controls\"> \n</p><p>After the unlicensed accounts are automatically archived, you can access the files in these accounts by enabling unlicensed account billing in the Microsoft 365 admin center. Once enabled, unlicensed account billing applies to all unlicensed OneDrive accounts in your tenant. There is a fee of $0.05/GB/month to store unlicensed accounts in the Microsoft 365 Archive, and a fee of $0.60/GB to reactivate accounts stored in the Microsoft 365 Archive. Account reactivation takes up to 24 hours and provides 30 days of access to the account, and then the account returns to an archived state.\n</p><p>If you take no action for OneDrive accounts that have been unlicensed for longer than 93 days, these accounts will remain inaccessible to end users until you set up an Azure subscription and enable unlicensed account billing in the Microsoft SharePoint admin center. This action will not affect tenants who have not changed the default tenant retention settings.\n</p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare</b>\n</p><p>To prepare for this change, admins can view a list of all the unlicensed OneDrive accounts in their tenant by going to the SharePoint admin center and navigating to <i>Reports &gt; OneDrive accounts</i> (this page will be rolled out to admins between July 26, 2024 and August 16, 2024). This page will provide the number of unlicensed accounts and why the accounts are unlicensed. You may have unlicensed accounts in your tenant for four reasons: \n</p><ol><li>Retention period – Account is no longer licensed but is still active because a retention period setting is keeping the account from being deleted.\n</li><li>Retention policy – Account is no longer licensed but is still active because a retention policy in Purview is keeping the account from being deleted. \n</li><li>Active user with no license – Account is active but is not licensed. This can happen if the license is removed but the user is not removed from Microsoft Entra ID (formerly Azure Active Directory).  \n</li><li>Duplicate accounts – Account is a duplicate because a licensed user has multiple OneDrive accounts associated with them. Duplicate accounts (also known as non-primary accounts) may arise if a user has geographic move, if a user leaves and then rejoins an organization, or from other factors. \n</li></ol><p>After you have taken inventory of your unlicensed accounts, we recommend that you take the following action before January 27, 2025. \n</p><ol><li>Delete unlicensed accounts that you no longer wish to retain. \n</li><li>Set up billing for accounts that you wish to retain.\n</li><li>You may want to notify your users about this change and update any relevant documentation.\n</li></ol><p>*<b>At this time, these changes do not apply to customers in Education tenants. An Education tenant is any tenant with more than 50% education licenses. Any tenant with fewer than 50% education licenses is considered commercial.&nbsp;</b>However, for any education tenant, unlicensed OneDrive accounts consume pooled storage and can pose security and compliance risks. IT admins can view the unlicensed accounts on the <i>OneDrive accounts</i> page to identify unlicensed accounts and take action.</p><p><i>Learn more</i>\n</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/SharePoint/unlicensed-onedrive-accounts\" target=\"_blank\">Manage unlicensed OneDrive user accounts - SharePoint in Microsoft 365 | Microsoft Learn</a>\n</li><li><a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/sharepoint/retention-and-deletion\" target=\"_blank\">OneDrive retention and deletion - SharePoint in Microsoft 365 | Microsoft Learn</a>\n</li><li><a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/admin/add-users/delete-a-user?view=o365-worldwide\" target=\"_blank\">Delete a user from your organization - Microsoft 365 admin | Microsoft Learn</a></li></ul><p></p>",

These challenges are particularly noticeable for participants joining remotely, using assistive technologies, or communicating through different modalities.</p><p>Before this rollout, sign language users face several challenges during meetings, including difficulty locating and identifying their interpreters, as well as ensuring proper positioning of interpreter video feeds. Furthermore, active speaker detection prioritizes audio, resulting in participants who communicate through sign language often receiving less visual prominence than verbal speakers. These challenges make it more difficult for Deaf and hard-of-hearing participants to remain fully engaged during meetings.\n</p><p>In Microsoft Teams, we are committed to addressing these gaps, with a particular focus on enhancing the meeting experience for Deaf and hard-of-hearing participants who communicate using sign language. As part of our initial efforts, we are introducing Sign Language Mode. When enabled, Sign language users will benefit from an enhanced meeting experience. Interpreters will be clearly identified in the participant roster and visually distinguished throughout meetings. Deaf and hard-of-hearing participants who use sign language will be automatically detected and elevated to active speaker status, ensuring equal prominence with spoken audio participants. This will help create a more equitable and collaborative environment for everyone.\n</p><p><b>NOTE:</b> Teams for Windows desktop and Teams for Mac desktop are required for sign language detection. Support for Teams for web will come later this year. Sign language detection will not work on mobile devices.

This policy provides four actions: <i>Off, Monitor, Block, </i>and <i>Dynamic delivery.</i> We made the <i>Monitor </i>action available for customers who wanted a <i>Safe attachments</i> policy to process attachments, deliver the emails (without blocking malicious attachments), and track what happened with attachments identified as malicious.  Customers used <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-office-365/try-microsoft-defender-for-office-365?view=o365-worldwide#reports-for-your-evaluation-or-trial-of-defender-for-office-365\" target=\"_blank\">reports </a>to see detections from the <i>Monitor </i>action in the policy.\n</p><p>As part of this retirement, if your organization has <i>Safe attachments</i> policies set to the <i>Monitor </i>action, we will automatically change the action in from <i>Monitor </i>to <i>Block.</i> We will not change the policy's recipients, status, or priority. After retirement, the <i>Monitor </i>option will not be available in the Safe Attachments policy page in the Defender security portal or the corresponding Microsoft PowerShell cmdlet.\n</p><p>Before retirement, you can find the <i>Monitor </i>action in Defender &gt; <i>Email &amp; collaboration &gt; Policies &amp; rules &gt; Threat policies &gt; Safe attachments &gt;</i> choose a policy or create a new policy &gt;<i> Edit settings</i> (or <i>Settings </i>if creating a new policy).

The report will also provide insights about other unexpected behavioral metric changes in these groups.</li><li>In addition to looking for large changes over time, the report looks for groups that are significantly different than “similar employees”. This leverages a new dynamic internal benchmark that uses role-based norms assessed over the company’s entire measured population to estimate an expected metric value for any group.</li></ul><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b></p><p>By default, this report will be enabled for all Insights Analyst users. Note that the dynamic internal benchmarks that are used to assess expected behavior are calculated based on the global partition of measured users, and as a result, analysts may be able to infer global role-based norms from these benchmarks. These global role-based norms are protected by a minimum group size of 25.</p><p>If for any reason you prefer that analysts in non-global partitions not have access to internal benchmarks, a global admin or Viva Insights admin can disable this report for all analysts in non-global partitions by using <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/viva/feature-access-management\" target=\"_blank\">Viva Insights Feature Access Management </a>(VFAM) to disable the feature. When the feature is disabled using VFAM, analysts in the global partition will still have access to the report, but analysts in non-global partitions will not.</p>",

The system can perform this task for an app after a device reboot and periodically as system conditions allow.</p><p><b>When this will happen:</b></p><p>General Availability (Worldwide, GCC, GCC High, DoD): We will begin rolling out late June 2025 (previously late May) and expect to complete by late July 2025 (previously late May).</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b></p><p>New tasks will be publicly visible in the Windows Task Scheduler.&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Task Names: Office Startup Boost and Office Startup Boost Logon.</li><li>Task Description: This task ensures that Office applications can take advantage of preloading performance enhancements.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>Initial roll-out will be on Microsoft Word. We have no announcements to make at this time regarding support for additional applications.</p><p>Startup Boost is only available when your PC has enough resources to run without impacting system performance. This includes having at least 8 GB of available RAM, and at least 5 GB of available disk space. When Startup Boost is active, the scheduled task will not run immediately at login to avoid slowing down your PC — it will wait 10 minutes to ensure the system is in a steady idle state. Additionally, Startup Boost will be disabled when Energy Saver mode is active. Startup Boost only runs if you have launched Word recently, and if you have not launched Word recently it will automatically disable itself.</p><p>Startup Boost is an optional performance feature. It is safe to disable. When disabled, Microsoft Office applications will be fully functional but may take longer to load. Customers can disable Startup Boost entirely by preventing the process from starting. To disable the feature, use the in-app setting, e.g., <i>Word &gt; Options &gt; General &gt; Startup Boost (under Start up Options)</i>.</p><p>Scheduled task entry in Task Scheduler:</p><p><img src=\"https://cxcs.microsoft.net/file/ccp/en-us/da011aba-1d94-42a5-8bb7-507075d26620\" style=\"width: 450px;\"></p><p><br></p><p>End-user UI to enable/disable Startup Boost in Word:</p><p><img src=\"https://cxcs.microsoft.net/file/ccp/en-us/e038abb2-c032-48ed-a891-5bfcba1bad8e\" style=\"width: 450px;\"><br></p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b></p><p>This rollout will happen automatically with no admin action required.&nbsp;</p><p>You can disable this Startup Boost task like any other scheduled task.

To enhance transparency and user control, Teams will introduce a new location consent experience that gives users the choice of when and how Teams can use their location data <b>specifically, the <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/win32/nativewifi/wi-fi-access-location-changes\" target=\"_blank\">SSID (service set identifier) and the BSSID (basic service set identifier</a>)</b>.</p><p><b>When this will happen:</b>\n</p><p>General Availability (Worldwide, GCC): We will begin rolling out early June 2025 (previously mid-May) and expect to complete by late May (previously early May).\n</p><p>General Availability (GCC High, DoD): We will begin rolling out late May 2025 (previously early May) and expect to complete by mid-June 2025 (previously early June).\n</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b></p><p>All new and existing Teams for Work users in your organization will be prompted to specify if they want to keep location detection on for emergency calls only or if they consent to allowing location access used for <i>IT Admin Insights</i>, for troubleshooting (with a tool such as the <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/cqd-what-is-call-quality-dashboard\" target=\"_blank\">Call Quality Dashboard</a>) or for <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/configure-dynamic-emergency-calling\" target=\"_blank\">Network and Location matching through BSSID</a> for emergency calling location.\n</p><p><b>NOTE: </b>The new Teams location consent flow does not apply to fully managed devices where users are restricted from user-granted location access.

Thank you for your patience.\n</p><p><a href=\"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-teams-blog/what-s-new-in-microsoft-teams-rooms-and-devices-at-enterprise/ba-p/3770137\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"font-family: sans-serif; font-weight: 400; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\">Earlier this year, the new Microsoft device ecosystem platform built on the Android Open-Source Project (AOSP) was announced</a> delivering state-of-the art security, reliability, and manageability with Microsoft Intune. Microsoft Teams Android devices will be migrating to this platform. The first step in the migration is a firmware update to Microsoft Teams Android devices in 2024. The firmware update will move devices from Android device administrator to Android AOSP management.</p><p><b>When this will happen:</b></p><p>A Preview program for select Microsoft Teams Android devices is targeted for Q2 of calendar year 2024. General release of the firmware update with the Android AOSP management stack will happen starting in Q4 of calendar year 2024 throughout Q1 of calendar year 2025 for all eligible Microsoft Teams Android devices. Auto updates will commence starting May 15th into Q3 calendar year 2025.</p><p>Eligible Microsoft Teams Android devices will initially receive a manual firmware update in Teams Admin Center so IT admins can manually verify the migration on their own schedule on select devices of their choosing.</p><p>Eventually, the firmware update for migration will be scheduled as an automatic firmware update in Teams Admin Center. This automatic firmware update can be deferred for up to 60 days from first availability based upon the admin configured stages in Teams Admin Center.</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b></p><p>The firmware upgrade, including the support for Intune management of Android (AOSP) devices must be accepted. It can be deferred for up to 60 days after it is first available. This can be done in the same way as other firmware upgrades in Teams Admin Center.&nbsp;</p><p>Devices will continue to remain signed in after the firmware upgrade.\n</p><p>Certain legacy devices will not receive the firmware upgrade for Android (AOSP) management in Intune. These devices will continue using Device Administrator.\n</p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b>\n</p><p>Policies will not be migrated automatically between Android device administrator and Android (AOSP) platforms. IT admins will need to create the appropriate new policies under the Intune Android (AOSP) platform to support their Microsoft Teams Android Devices. \n</p><p>This will need to be done before taking the firmware update for a successful migration. \n</p><p>More details on enabling support and creating enrollment profiles and policies for Intune AOSP can be found here: <a href=\"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/microsoftteamssupport/moving-teams-android-devices-to-aosp-device-management/4140893\" target=\"_blank\">Moving Teams Android Devices to AOSP Device Management | Microsoft Community Hub</a></p>\n\n \n<table><tbody>\n\n<tr><th>OEM</th>\n<th>Device Type</th>\n<th>Models</th>\n<th>Targeted Release</th>\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n<td>AudioCodes</td>\n<td>Phones</td>\n<td>C470HD</td>\n<td>Available</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr><td>AudioCodes&nbsp;</td><td>Phones</td>\n<td>C430HD\n<br>C435HD\n<br>C455HD<br></td>\n<td>Available</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr><td>AudioCodes&nbsp;</td>\n<td>Rooms</td>\n<td>RXV81<br>RXV200<br>RXPad<br></td>\n<td>Available</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n<td>Audiocodes</td>\n<td>Panels</td>\n<td>RX Panel</td>\n<td>Available</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n<td>Creston</td>\n<td>Panels</td>\n<td>TSS-770<br>TSS-1070<br></td>\n<td>April 2025</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n<td>Creston</td>\n<td>Rooms</td>\n<td>Crestron AIO Video Bar 70 \n<br>Crestron Touch Panel TS-1070<br></td>\n<td>March 2025</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n<td>Cisco</td>\n<td>Rooms</td>\n<td>Cisco Room Bar\n<br>Cisco Room Bar Pro \n<br>Cisco Room Kit EQ \n<br>Cisco Room Kit Pro\n<br>Cisco Desk Pro\n<br>Cisco Room Kit EQX \n<br>Cisco Board Pro G2 75\n<br>Cisco Board Pro 55\n<br>Cisco Board Pro 75\n<br>Cisco Board Pro G2 55 \n<br>Cisco Navigator<br></td>\n<td>Available</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n<td>Cisco</td>\n<td>Panels</td>\n<td>Cisco Navigator Panel</td>\n<td>Available</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n<td>DTEN</td>\n<td>Rooms</td>\n<td>DTEN D7X 75\"\n<br>DTEN D7X 55\" \n<br>DTEN Bar\n<br>DTEN Mate TC<br></td>\n<td>Available</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n<td>Jabra</td>\n<td>Rooms</td>\n<td>Jabra Panacast 50 VBS\n<br>Jabra Panacast 50 TC<br></td>\n<td>Available</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n<td>Logitech</td>\n<td>Rooms</td>\n<td>RallyBar <b>VR0019</b>\n<br>RallyBar mini <b>VR0020</b>\n<br>TAP IP <b>VR0029</b>\n<br>TAP\n<br>RoomMate <b>VR0030</b>\n<br>Logi Rallybar Huddle (VR0034]<br></td>\n<td>March 2025</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n<td>Logitech</td>\n<td>Panels</td>\n<td>Tap Scheduler  <b>VR0028</b>\n<br>DockFlex <b>VR0035</b><br></td>\n<td>March 2025</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n<td>Neat</td>\n<td>Rooms</td>\n<td>Neat Pad <b>NF19A1</b>\n<br>Neat Bar <b>NF19B1</b> \n<br>Neat Board <b>NF19C1</b>\n<br>Neat Bar Pro <b>NF21D1</b>\n<br>Neat Bar Gen2 <b>NF22E1</b>\n<br>Neat Board 50 <b>NF22H1</b>\n<br>Neat Board Pro 65  <b>NF23K1</b><br></td>\n<td>April 2025</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n<td>Neat</td>\n<td>Panels</td>\n<td>Neat Pad <b>NF19A1</b></td>\n<td>April 2025</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n<td>Neat</td>\n<td>Displays</td><td>Neat Frame <b>NF21F1</b></td>\n<td>TBD</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n<td>Poly</td>\n<td>Phones</td>\n<td>CCX350 \n<br>CCX400\n<br>CCX500\n<br>CCX505\n<br>CCX600\n<br>TrioC60<br></td>\n<td>March 25</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n<td>Poly</td>\n<td>Rooms</td>\n<td>Poly Studio X30\n<br>Poly Studio X50\n<br>Poly Studio X52\n<br>Poly Studio X70\n<br>Poly Studio X72\n<br>Poly Studio G7500\n<br>Poly Studio G62\n<br>Poly TC8\n<br>Poly TC10<br></td>\n<td>March 2025</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n<td>Poly</td>\n<td>Panels</td>\n<td>TC10 - Panel</td>\n<td>March 2025</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n<td>Yealink</td>\n<td>Phones  <b>MP5X</b></td>\n<td>MP54\n<br>MP56\n<br>MP58\n<br>CP965<br></td>\n<td>March 2025</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n<td>Yealink</td>\n<td>Phones  <b>MP5X E2</b></td>\n<td>MP52E2\n<br>MP54E2\n<br>MP56E2 \n<br>MP58E2<br></td>\n<td>March 2025</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n<td>Yealink</td>\n<td>Rooms</td>\n<td>Yealink MeetingBar A10\n<br>Yealink MeetingBar A20\n<br>Yealink MeetingBar A30\n<br>Yealink MeetingBar A40\n<br>Yealink MeetingBoard 65\"\n<br>Yealink MeetingBoard 86\"\n<br>Yealink Deskvision A24\n<br>Yealink CTP18 \n<br>Yealink CTP25<br></td>\n<td>Available</td>\n</tr>\n\n\n<tr>\n<td>Yealink</td>\n<td>Rooms</td>\n<td>Yealink MeetingBar A40</td>\n<td><br>March 2025</td>\n\n</tr><tr>\n<td>Yealink</td>\n<td>Panels</td>\n<td>Room Panel\n<br>RoomPanel Plus<br></td>\n<td><br>Available</td>\n\n</tr><tr>\n<td>Yealink</td>\n<td>Panels</td>\n<td>Room Panel E2\n<br>RoomPanel Plus E2<br></td>\n<td><br>April 2025</td>\n</tr>\n\n\n</tbody></table>",

No specific user action is required. Links to the previous domains are backwards compatible and continue to be supported.

Thank you for your patience.</p><p>Non-Native and Hybrid Microsoft Viva Engage (formerly Yammer) Networks will be upgraded to Native Mode to allow users, groups, and content to be compatible with and mapped to their counterparts in Azure Active Directory and Microsoft 365. Native Mode also provides other benefits, such as the ability to host Live Events in every Viva Engage community and simplify file administration through SharePoint. Most critically, Native Mode supports eDiscovery through the Microsoft Purview compliance portal, allowing your organization to collaborate safely and securely within your Viva Engage network. 90% of Viva Engage networks are in Native Mode today, including our top 10 largest networks.<br></p><p><b>When this will happen:</b></p><p>We will begin migrating networks on December 01, 2022, and continue the upgrades through late December 2024 (previously January). The process will begin with smaller networks. If you prefer to control the timing of your upgrade, you may initiate the process on your own at any time by visiting the Microsoft 365 Native Mode page within the Network Admin pages of Viva Engage.\n</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b></p><p>You will lose access to the following features:\n</p><ul><li>Network-level guests \n</li><li>Email blocked lists\n</li><li>Secret groups\n</li></ul><p>If your organization has active guest users, <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/yammer/get-started-with-yammer/azure-ad-b2b-guests-yammer\" target=\"_blank\">Azure Active Directory B2B guest functionality</a> can be used for guests who reside in the same geography as the Viva Engage network (US guests for US networks; EU guests for EU networks). Guests will need to be reinvited to your network.\n</p><p>If your organization currently uses an email blocked list to manage access to your Viva Engage network, you can continue to manage access from the Azure Active Directory Portal. Learn more by visiting <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/viva/engage/manage-viva-engage-users/add-block-or-remove-users\" target=\"_blank\">Add, block, or remove a Viva Engage user</a> and <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/viva/engage/manage-engage-licenses-microsoft-365\" target=\"_blank\">Manage Viva Engage Core user licenses in Microsoft 365</a>.\n</p><p>These feature equivalents are only available to networks in Native Mode. There is no feature equivalent to secret groups in Microsoft 365; all groups must be public or private.\n</p><p>As part of the migration process, the Viva Engage administrator account will be added to all groups in the network, and files may be renamed.\n</p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b></p><p><i>If you would like to self-initiate your migration:\n</i></p><ul><li>There is a <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/yammer/configure-your-yammer-network/native-mode-step-by-step-guide\" target=\"_blank\">step-by-step guide to Native Mode migration</a> available. You can run an alignment report that will identify gaps in your current network alignment with Native Mode. It is critical that you back up your network’s data and communicate the migration to your users prior to running the Alignment Tool mentioned in the guide, as some data may be deleted during the process.\n</li></ul><p><i>If you would like Microsoft to initiate your migration:\n</i></p><ul><li>You are not required to take any action. You can run an alignment report that will identify gaps in your current network alignment with Native Mode. It is strongly recommended that you back up your data and communicate the migration to your users prior to your scheduled migration start date.

The Microsoft Copilot app has now shipped 100% worldwide to Teams and is available to install and pin.</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b></p><p>Starting mid-January, Microsoft Copilot admins and users will be able to pin the Copilot app in Teams and Outlook. Copilot will not be pinned by default for users without a Microsoft 365 Copilot license.  If pinned, users will be able to access the Microsoft Copilot app in Teams and Outlook.\n</p><p>If your admins or users previously chose to pin Microsoft Copilot across the M365 app, Teams, and Outlook before pinning was released on Teams and Outlook, Microsoft Copilot will be retroactively pinned for them there.</p><p>Microsoft Copilot will also be added to the Store for users to add on their own. For licensed users, Microsoft 365 Copilot has already been installed, and users can open it from the Store.</p><p>Finally, in Teams, users with a Microsoft 365 Copilot license will be able to access Copilot in the left rail as a pinned app by default, along with the Teams Chat pane where they can find it today. On Teams Mobile, users can access Copilot in the top header, and on Outlook Mobile in the tab bar.</p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b>\n</p><p>Admins can control if Microsoft Copilot is pinned in Teams and Outlook using the <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/copilot/microsoft-365/pin-copilot\" target=\"_blank\">same Copilot pinning control shared previously to pin Copilot in the Microsoft 365 app.</a> Admins can also pin Microsoft Copilot in Teams by adding Copilot to Pinned apps in <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/teams-app-setup-policies\" target=\"_blank\">app Setup policies</a> and assigning the policies to unlicensed users in Teams admin center.\n</p><p>With the pinning control, you have the option to pin or not pin Copilot for your users. If you select to not pin Copilot, you also have the option to allow your users to be notified to make this choice. If no action is taken, Copilot will not be pinned but users will be notified to pin it themselves.\n</p><p>Users can unpin Copilot in Outlook. Users can unpin Copilot in Teams if User pinning is enabled in app <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/teams-app-setup-policies#pin-apps\" target=\"_blank\">Setup policies.</a>\n</p><p>Currently, you can remove access to Copilot in the Microsoft 365 app and copilot.cloud.microsoft as documented in <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/copilot/manage#removing-access-to-microsoft-\" target=\"_blank\">Removing access to Microsoft Copilot</a>. These controls will continue to be respected as the Copilot app rolls out in Outlook and Teams. \n</p><p>In addition, you will be able to allow and block the Copilot app from appearing in Outlook, the Microsoft 365 app and copilot.cloud.microsoft through <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/admin/manage/teams-apps-work-on-outlook-and-m365?view=o365-worldwide#how-to-block-an-app\" target=\"_blank\">Microsoft 365 admin center (MAC)</a> like you would manage availability for any other app. These controls are already provided today for Microsoft Teams through <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/copilot/manage#removing-access-to--chat\" target=\"_blank\">Teams admin center.</a></p><p>\n</p><p>\n</p><p>\n</p><p><b>\n</b></p>",

      "Content": "<p>Updated April 21, 2025: We have updated the timelines below. Thank you for your patience.</p><p>To reduce the risk of misuse and abuse of Exchange Online resources and ensure service availability for all users, we’ll soon introduce new tenant-level outbound email limits, known as the Tenant External Recipient Rate Limit or TERRL. The TERRL restricts the number of external recipients a tenant can send email to per day. If the limit is exceeded further messages sent to external recipients from the tenant will be blocked until the volume for the last 24 hours drops below the quota. A tenant’s TERRL quota is calculated based on the number of email licenses a tenant has purchased. Here is the formula used to calculate a tenant’s quota:\n</p><p>500 * (Purchased Email Licenses^0.7) + 9500\n</p><p>To help admins plan and track their outbound email volume, you’ll find a new report in the Exchange admin center: <i>EAC &gt; Reports &gt; Mail flow &gt; Tenant Outbound External Recipients Rate</i>. This report shows the current volume of external recipients, your tenant’s daily quota, how much of the quota is used, and the number of recipients that were blocked if the limit was exceeded. The report will also show if enforcement for the limit is enabled or disabled. For example, for tenants who have more than 500 email licenses it will show “Disabled” until May 1st, the day we’ll start to enable enforcement for tenants who have more than 500 licenses.\n</p><p><b>When this will happen:</b></p><p>This change will roll out in progressive stages over the month of March as per the following rollout schedule:</p><table class=\"table table-bordered\"><tbody><tr><td>Phase</td><td>Enable enforcement for tenant group</td><td>Rollout start date</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Tenants with &lt;= 25 email licenses</td><td>April 3, 2025</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>+ additional tenants with &lt;= 200 licenses</td><td>April 18, 2025</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>+ additional tenants with &lt;= 500 licenses</td><td>April 28, 2025</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>+ all remaining tenants</td><td>May 9, 2025</td></tr></tbody></table><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b></p><p>If your tenant exceeds its daily outbound sending limit further messages sent to external recipients will be blocked and senders will receive one of the following bounce messages (also known as Non-Delivery Receipts or NDRs):\n</p><ul><li>Trial tenants: 550 5.7.232 - Your message can't be sent because your trial tenant has exceeded its daily limit for sending email to external recipients (tenant external recipient rate limit)\n</li><li>Non-trial tenants: 550 5.7.233 - Your message can't be sent because your tenant exceeded its daily limit for sending email to external recipients (tenant external recipient rate limit)\n</li></ul><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b></p><p>Check the report in the EAC to see your tenant’s quota and current daily outbound email volume and whether or not any messages will be blocked once the TERRL is enabled for your tenant. If your current outbound email volume is well below the quota, you don’t have to do anything. If your outbound email volume is near or exceeding your quota, consider using <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/communication-services/overview\" target=\"_blank\">Azure Communication Services email</a> for high-volume email to external recipients instead. ACS email which offers significant advantages and features for high-volume email, especially for external recipients. Messages sent using ACS email are not counted against your Tenant External Recipient Rate Limit quota.\n</p><p>For more information about the Tenant External Recipient Rate feature and report please see this blog post:\n</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/exchange/introducing-exchange-online-tenant-outbound-email-limits/4372797\" target=\"_blank\">Introducing Exchange Online Tenant Outbound Email Limits</a></li></ul>",

We have made progress on closing several parity gaps with more changes in development to be released in the coming quarters. Please refer to <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/exchange/clients-and-mobile-in-exchange-online/deprecation-of-ews-exchange-online\" target=\"_blank\">Deprecation of Exchange Web Services in Exchange Online</a> for up-to-date guidance and roadmap information.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>If you haven't already, start the process of working with your application development organization and your application vendors to migrate active EWS applications on your tenant to the Graph API.&nbsp;</p><p>\n</p><p><b>When this will happen:</b></p><p>October 1, 2026</p><p><b>How this affects your organization:</b></p><p>While the EWS components of the service will continue to receive security updates and certain non-security updates, product design and features will remain unchanged. This change also applies to the EWS SDKs for Java and .NET, as well.\n</p><p>Despite this announcement, EWS is still available and supported for use in production environments. But we strongly suggest migrating to Microsoft Graph to access Exchange Online data and gain access to the latest features and functionality.\n</p><p>Today’s update and the retirement of EWS apply only to Microsoft 365 and Exchange Online (all environments); there are no changes to EWS in Exchange Server. Further, the changes in Exchange Online do not affect Outlook for Windows or Mac, Teams, or any other Microsoft product.</p><p>In our original blog post, we said this change would affect only third-party (non-Microsoft) applications.<b> We have expanded our effort and are now also removing EWS dependencies from Microsoft apps and services, and we’re going to complete that work well before October 2026</b>. We intend to do this as quickly as possible without affecting the quality of service or product.&nbsp;</p><p>There may be applications running on your tenant created by your organization or 3rd parties that use EWS. <b>We recommend <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/admin/activity-reports/ews-usage?view=o365-worldwide\" target=\"_blank\">reviewing your application portfolio</a> now </b>to get an understanding of which apps need to be updated by your organization and which applications require updates from vendors.</p><p>It is important to get started with this effort as soon as possible as the Graph API patterns are quite different from EWS. Equivalent Graph API operations may exhibit subtle differences that affect your use cases and application designs in unanticipated ways.</p><p>Migrating Applications to Microsoft Graph&nbsp;</p><p>We know there are several feature gaps between EWS and Microsoft Graph, and though the list below is not exhaustive, these are the gaps most frequently reported to us by developers:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Access to Archive Mailboxes – We are working on delivering access to archive mailboxes via Microsoft Graph and will provide an updated timeline in the coming months.\n</li><li>Folder Associated Information / User Configuration – We are working on these features and will provide an updated timeline in the coming months.\n</li><li>Exchange Online Management – We are investigating solutions for this and will provide an updated timeline in the coming months.</li><li>Access to Public Folders – After evaluating the usage of public folders, we have decided to restrict programmatic access to public folders to supported Outlook clients only, and for bulk import/export purposes. We will not provide APIs for programmatically creating, reading, updating and deleting public folders after October 2026 (also see <a href=\"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/exchange/security-related-updates-in-exchange-online/4303525\" target=\"_blank\">Security Related Updates in Exchange Online</a>).&nbsp;</li></ul><div><br></div><p>We know there are other gaps not listed above, and we continue to work on closing them, but it’s possible some functionality will not make it to Microsoft Graph. We encourage you to refer to <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/exchange/clients-and-mobile-in-exchange-online/deprecation-of-ews-exchange-online\" target=\"_blank\">Deprecation of Exchange Web Services in Exchange Online</a> for up-to-date guidance and roadmap information.&nbsp;</p><p><b>Next Steps\n</b></p><p>The retirement of these APIs follows our <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/lifecycle/policies/modern\" target=\"_blank\">Modern Lifecycle Policy</a>. We understand changes like this may cause some inconvenience, but we are confident it will ensure more secure, reliable, and performant experiences.\n</p><p>We will publish regular communications as we progress towards this deadline to aid affected tenants in identifying EWS usage. We encourage all customers to monitor Message Center and the Exchange Blog and <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/exchange/clients-and-mobile-in-exchange-online/deprecation-of-ews-exchange-online\" target=\"_blank\">Deprecation of Exchange Web Services in Exchange Online </a>for related content.&nbsp;</p><p>Thank you in advance for updating and opening your apps to a wider range of useful and intelligent features on Microsoft Graph. We are extremely excited about the growing opportunities that Microsoft Graph offers to developers, and we remain fully committed to our journey to empower developers to access Microsoft 365 data with the most modern features and tools.</p>",

Starting in June 2025, users of OneNote for Windows 10 may experience changes to their sync behavior due to updates in security and services, which may require reopening notebooks to resume syncing. Additionally, the sync experience on OneNote for Windows 10 may be slower compared to OneNote on Windows.\n</li><li><b>A Smooth Transition Experience</b>: Starting in July 2025, users of OneNote for Windows 10 will receive in-app banner notifications guiding them to switch to OneNote for Microsoft 365 ensuring a smooth transition and continuity in their workflow.</li></ul><p><b>What you can do to prepare:</b></p><p>To help your users transition smoothly, we recommend starting the migration process now.

      "Content": "<p>Coming soon: You will be able to extend Microsoft Purview to the network layer by integrating Purview with your preferred Secure Access Service Edge (SASE) / Security Service Edge (SSE) solution. Through this integration, admins can intercept and inspect traffic flowing through the network layer to identify the presence of sensitive data. This enables admins to detect sensitive data shared with untrusted cloud applications through browsers, applications, APIs, add-ins, and more, including common generative AI, cloud storage, and content sharing services. The signals from inline discovery for the network further enrich Purview solutions including Data Security Posture Management (DSPM) and Insider Risk Management (IRM), helping admins better understand how to reduce data exfiltration risks to locations outside of their organization.

Thank you for your patience.\n</p><p>Coming soon for Microsoft Purview: We are announcing the public preview of the integration of Adaptive protection with Data Lifecycle Management (DLM) to help you find the right balance to protect against data sabotage while enabling productivity. This new integration leverages DLM features to provide an additional control for Adaptive protection that automatically preserves items deleted by a user with an elevated risk level, so items can be restored if needed.</p><p>This message is associated with Microsoft 365 Roadmap ID <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?filters=&amp;searchterms=392839\" target=\"_blank\">392839</a>.\n</p><p><b>When this will happen:</b>\n</p><p>Public preview: We will begin rolling out in late June 2024 (previously early May) and expect to complete by late July 2024 (previously mid-July).\n</p><p>General Availability:&nbsp; We will begin rolling out in late September 2025 (previously late May) and expect to complete by mid-October 2025 (previously mid-June).</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b>\n</p><p>After the rollout, and after you enable Adaptive protection for your tenant, the retention label and auto-apply policy for data lifecycle management will be automatically created for you. This policy will automatically include elevated risk users identified by Microsoft Purview | Insider Risk Management solution. If these users delete content from Microsoft SharePoint, Microsoft OneDrive, or Microsoft Exchange, a retention label is automatically applied to that content to retain it for 120 days. Retention labels are automatically applied to unlabeled content deleted by these users. When these users are no longer at the elevated risk level, they are automatically removed from the DLM policy, and the system will no longer keep a copy of content they delete. Any content copies previously retained when the user had an elevated risk level will be kept for the 120 days as specified by the retention label.\n</p><p>Unlike other retention labeling scenarios, users do not see the retention label, and you do not need to create or manage the retention label or policy. At this time, you can't change the retention period or assign different policies based on the different risk levels, or for different locations. The single retention label and auto-labeling policy for your tenant is not visible in the Microsoft Purview compliance portal.</p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b>\n</p><p>Learn more: <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/purview/retention#dynamically-mitigate-the-risk-of-accidental-or-malicious-deletes\" target=\"_blank\">Learn about retention policies &amp; labels to retain or delete | Microsoft Learn</a>\n</p><p>If you're using Adaptive protection and want to automatically retain content deleted by elevated risk users, follow these steps to turn on this new integration.\n</p><ol><li>Sign in to the <a href=\"https://compliance.microsoft.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Microsoft Purview compliance portal</a>.\n</li><li>Navigate to <i>Data lifecycle management &gt; Microsoft 365 &gt; Adaptive protection settings</i> in the top right corner.\n</li><li>Turn the setting ON and select <i>Save</i>.\n</li></ol><p>\n</p><p><img src=\"https://cxcs.microsoft.net/file/messagecenter/en-us/fe6a20ed-77ce-44ce-b862-bc7f4b78b93e\" style=\"width: 400px;\" alt=\"admin settings\">\n</p><p><img src=\"https://cxcs.microsoft.net/file/messagecenter/en-us/521b359c-13a9-41ef-ad96-215789a32eb3\" style=\"width: 400px;\" alt=\"admin settings\">\n</p><p>If you’re not using Adaptive protection already, turn on Adaptive protection and the new feature will be enabled along with Adaptive protection.\n</p><p>This rollout will happen automatically by the specified date with no admin action required before the rollout.

Between July 1st and August 1st, 2025, we will gradually switch provisioning of all A records for new Accepted Domains into the new subdomains under mx.microsoft.</p><p>We are doing this to reduce the friction of adopting DNSSEC in the long run. DNSSEC is a set of extensions to DNS that provides cryptographic verification of DNS records, preventing DNS spoofing and adversary-in-the-middle attacks to DNS.\n</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b>\n</p><p>After August 1st 2025, all A records for new Accepted Domains will be provisioned into the new subdomains under mx.microsoft.\n</p><p>DNS resolution will safely fallback to “plain” DNS if a domain is not DNSSEC enabled. If an Accepted Domain you add to the Exchange Admin Center after July 1st is not secured with DNSSEC at the domain level (ex. contoso.com), then DNS resolution will work as usual. If an Accepted Domain you add to the EAC after July 1st is secured with DNSSEC, then DNSSEC will extend to the mx.microsoft DNS record automatically and you will get the benefits of DNSSEC without having to take any further action. Any issues with DNSSEC can be addressed by disabling DNSSEC for the Accepted Domain (ex. contoso.com) via your DNS provider.\n</p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b>\n</p><p>If you have any automation in place, for example in workflows for Domain Setup, for MX record creation that expects A records for newly provisioned Accepted Domains to be provisioned in mail.protection.outlook.com, this automation needs to be updated by July 1st to use List serviceConfigurationRecords Graph API (<a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/graph/api/domain-list-serviceconfigurationrecords?view=graph-rest-1.0&amp;tabs=http\" target=\"_blank\">List serviceConfigurationRecords</a>). Use List serviceConfigurationRecords to retrieve the mailExchange value for your MX record. After July 1st, List serviceConfigurationRecords Graph API will be the only source of truth for your Accepted Domains’ MX record value. You will not be able to rely on the Accepted Domain’s A record being provisioned in mail.protection.outlook.com after July 1st.\n</p><p>If you are using automation that expects the record to end with mail.protection.outlook.com, when you add a new Accepted Domain to the Exchange Admin Center after July 1st, mail flow may not work upon initial configuration and you will have to update your MX record to match what the Exchange Admin Center says for the domain or use the mailExchange value returned by List serviceConfigurationRecords Graph API.\n</p><p>If you expect this change to cause any issues for your organization, please share that feedback. \n</p><p><br></p>",

Bookings allows users to create customizable booking pages where customers, clients, or colleagues can easily schedule time with them or their team without the usual back-and-forth communication.\n</p><p>Coming soon: We will launch Queue as a new functionality in Bookings. Queue will be available in Bookings for users with a Microsoft Teams Premium license.\n</p><p>Queue is a powerful feature that provides real-time visibility and control over incoming appointments. Queue provides schedulers and admins with a consolidated view of each day's appointments in chronological order for the booking pages they manage, so they can better manage the load of incoming appointments and reassign delayed appointments to available staff. Staff can also self-serve on busy days by assigning the unassigned appointments to themselves, helping to balance workloads across teams or specific services.

This migration aims to improve data consistency and reliability, particularly in investigation and threat-hunting experiences.\n</p><p><b>When this will happen:</b>\n</p><p>General Availability (Worldwide, GCC, GCC High, DoD): We began rolling out this migration early November 2024 and expect to complete by late June 2025.</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b></p><p><i>Key benefits</i></p><ul><li><i>Ensures data consistency across multiple user experiences: </i>By consolidating data management under a unified platform, this migration will eliminate discrepancies between different workflows, ensuring that security analysts have access to consistent and reliable data across various investigation and hunting experiences.\n</li><li><i>Establishes data parity between Threat Explorer and Advanced Hunting: </i>By leveraging a single, unified data source, the migration will ensure that data retrieved in Threat Explorer and Advanced Hunting remains synchronized. This reduces the chances of data disparity between different tools and allows security teams to conduct investigations with better accuracy.\n</li><li><i>Enhances the data pipeline for Advanced Hunting, resulting in improved performance and accuracy</i>: The migration will optimize data ingestion pipeline and proactive monitoring system of Advanced Hunting. This will lead to improved data freshness and reduce the chances of potential data quality issues in data pipeline.\n</li><li><i>Accelerates development cycles for new features built on the new data platform: </i>The modernized data architecture will enable faster iteration and deployment of new features. By reducing dependencies on legacy systems and adopting a scalable infrastructure, Microsoft can introduce feature enhancements more rapidly, bringing greater value to security analysts.\n</li><li><i>Strengthens proactive monitoring capabilities to minimize potential impact on customer workflows:</i> The new platform will enhance real-time monitoring and alerting mechanisms, allowing for proactive detection and resolution of issues before they impact user workflows. Improved observability will ensure that any latency or disruptions are identified early, reducing downtime and improving system reliability.</li></ul><p><i>Potential impact</i></p><ul><li>No direct impact on customer data.\n</li><li>While the new platform brings significant improvements, users may experience slight delays in data availability (such as email metadata and post-delivery actions like quarantine release and manual remediation) in certain experiences, including Threat Explorer, Email Entity, and the Email Summary Panel.\n</li><li>In some cases, users may encounter intermittent failures for brief moment when loading the Email Summary Panel from experiences such as Quarantine and Submission immediately after an email is delivered. However, this will automatically resolve once the necessary data has been processed and stored.</li></ul><p><i>Resolution plan</i></p><p>While our team works on the migration, we are also actively working on optimizing the performance of the new data platform to align as closely as possible with the data freshness rate of Threat Explorer before the data platform migration. Also, efforts are underway to minimize failure rates across user experiences caused by temporary data unavailability.\n</p><p>The phase 1 performance improvement work is expected to be completed by late June 2025. After that, our teams will be continuously monitoring the latencies and investing in further improvements to ensure seamless security operations experience to end users.</p><p>This change will be available by default.</p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b></p><p>This migration will happen automatically by the specified dates with no admin action required before the rollout.

Once administrators are within the Data Lifecycle Management (DLM) Solution on Microsoft Purview, they can visit the Priority Cleanup tab and follow the wizard to set-up this policy. Like auto-apply retention labels, Priority Cleanup supports policy simulation mode, so administrators can check the returned samples in case the policy configuration needs any fine-tuning before enabling the policy. Once set-up, because the deletion by a priority cleanup policy is irreversible and can override existing holds, the process requires multiple approvals, specific roles, and is audited. Thus, respective reviewers must be mandatorily added during policy creation to allow for disposition of items under a retention or e-Discovery hold.&nbsp;</p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b>\n</p><p>Because of the built-in safeguards, the feature itself is enabled by default at the tenant level. However, Priority Cleanup can be turned off on the Priority Cleanup settings page.

A new role permission \"Priority cleanup administrator\" is now added to Purview role permissions to enable data governance administrators to use this feature.</p>",

We recommend that you proactively inform your users of the change and direct them to M365.cloud.microsoft (formerly Office.com and Microsoft365.com) and SharePoint Online.

Thank you for your patience.</p><p>Coming soon: A new license request feature and self-service purchase for Microsoft 365 Copilot will be widely available for all tenants. End user license request and self-service purchase will now be available for users with Microsoft 365 E1, Microsoft 365 E3, Microsoft 365 E5, Microsoft Office 365 Plan E1, Microsoft Office 365 Plan E3, Enterprise Mobility + Security E3, Enterprise Mobility + Security E5, Microsoft 365 Apps for Business and standalone products.  Both License request and self-service purchase will be shown within Microsoft 365 apps such as Copilot Chat, the unpaid version of work chat included in your Microsoft 365 subscription.  \n</p><p>\n</p><p>License Request allows users to request a Microsoft 365 Copilot license directly from their admin. This helps you efficiently assign unused licenses or purchase additional ones and assign based on user request. Global admins, license admins, and user admins will be able to manage these requests seamlessly in the Microsoft 365 admin center and can choose between standard or custom messaging, including directing to a third-party URL.</p><p>Self-Service Purchase allows users to purchase Microsoft 365 Copilot licenses directly with their own credit card and use within their tenant with their Microsoft admin’s visibility and control. <b>Note: </b>If your organization has previously disabled self-service purchase for Microsoft 365 Copilot, your existing settings will be honored.</p><p>This message is related to MC853238 (Updated) Microsoft 365 admin center: New self-service purchase and trial settings (published August 2024, updated September 2024). This message is also related to MC886385 Copilot for Microsoft 365 available for self-service purchase (November 2024) and MC899941 Microsoft 365 Copilot: Self-service purchase settings in Microsoft 365 admin center (E3, E5) (September 2024).</p><p> \n</p><p><b>When this will happen:</b> \n</p><p>General availability (Worldwide): We will begin rolling out late March 2025 and expect to complete by late May 2025.  \n</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b> \n</p><p><i><u>License Request:  \n</u></i></p><p>After this rollout, global admins, license admins and user admins will be able to manage license requests in the Microsoft 365 admin center, where you can approve or deny the request.  \n</p><p>Notifications in the Microsoft 365 admin center of pending license requests from users:&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cxcs.microsoft.net/file/messagecenter/en-us/52468d5d-c55b-463d-acce-66e7e2897d27\" width=\"400\" height=\"\"></p><p>Admins can manage user requests in the Microsoft 365 admin center on the Licenses page:</p><p><img src=\"https://cxcs.microsoft.net/file/messagecenter/en-us/bb3b31a0-eac5-49c0-af95-f2c4b49a4b7c\" width=\"400\" height=\"\"></p><p>This change will be available by default to users.

Rollout for scheduled meetings and channel Meet Now will be started in early July 2025 and expected to be completed by mid-July 2025. </p><p>General Availability (GCC High, DoD):&nbsp; We will begin rolling out early August 2025 (previously early June) and expect to complete by mid-August 2025 (previously late June).</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b>\n</p><p>The new URL syntax is: https://teams.microsoft.com/meet/&lt;meeting_id&gt;?p=&lt;HashedPasscode&gt; \n</p><p>To make meeting URL shorter, we are removing several parameters such as tenant ID, conversation ID etc. This change serves two main goals: 1) improving usability of URL during sharing and 2) making the URL more secure and less susceptible to malicious attacks. \n</p><p>Here are some details about how meeting links work and when they expire: \n</p><ol><li>In case the meeting organizer gets removed from the tenant, the links to the meetings scheduled by them automatically expire. \n</li><li>&nbsp;Every meeting link expires in 60 days after the scheduled event or in 8 hours, if it was created as Meet Now. Learn more about expiration timelines for different types of meetings. \n</li></ol><p>With the Short Meeting URL release, expiration limit will be applied to all newly created links. \n</p><p>Once the change to Short Meeting URL is released, all newly created meetings will expire as described in the documentation: 60 days after meeting ends for scheduled meetings and 8 hours after creation for Meet Now. Once this expiry period is over, in case someone clicks the link (e.g. outside of Teams app OR in the meeting details inside Teams calendar section), they will be unable to join the meeting.</p><p>Note: Old links created before short meeting URL release will continue working as it previously was (user will be able to join even after the documented expiry limits).</p><p>The reason why we are making this change is simple: security is our topmost priority. Maintaining a high security level is essential to protect sensitive data, prevent financial losses, ensure business continuity, and meet compliance and legal obligations. It is a critical aspect of modern digital life and business operations. This adjustment is designed to enhance the security of Teams meeting links, thereby better safeguarding the customer tenant. We want to be on par with modern security standards, that’s why the new behavior is a step in the right direction that we must take. It’s not possible to keep the current behavior. If you think it breaks some of your business processes, please leave comment to the MC post and describe your case there. \n</p><p>Recommendations in case the meeting link has expired:  \n</p><p>For meeting organizer: We recommend scheduling a new meeting. If the meeting organizer got removed from the tenant someone else should reschedule their meetings from scratch. \n</p><p>For participant: Please reach out to the meeting organizer and ask them to reschedule the meeting or send you an updated link.</p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b>\n</p><p>You may want to check if you have any integrations that use parameters from URL. After the rollout, the URL will only contain the meeting ID. Parameters such as tenant ID, organizer ID, conversation ID and message ID will not be in the URL. \n</p><p>You may inform meeting organizers from your tenant who use expired meeting links, or you may want to make a tenant-wide announcement about this change. \n</p><p>This rollout will happen automatically by the specified date with no admin action required. You may want to notify your users about this change and update any relevant documentation as appropriate.</p>",

The current behavior of the EWSEnabled flag is that it can be set at both the tenant (organization) level and the user (mailbox) level. Currently, when the flag is set to true at the user level, it takes precedence over the organization-level setting. If a setting is Null, it means the setting is not enforced at that level. If Org and user-level are both Null, the default behavior is to allow. This hierarchical structure means that if the organization-level flag is set to false, but the user-level flag is set to true, EWS requests from that user are still allowed. In summary:</p><table class=\"table table-bordered\"><tbody><tr><td>Organization Level</td><td>User Level&nbsp;</td><td>EWS Requests</td></tr><tr><td>True or &lt;null&gt;</td><td>True or &lt;null&gt;</td><td>Allowed</td></tr><tr><td>True or &lt;null&gt;</td><td>False</td><td>Not Allowed</td></tr><tr><td>False</td><td>True</td><td>Allowed</td></tr><tr><td>False</td><td>False or &lt;null&gt;</td><td>Not Allowed</td></tr></tbody></table><p>This approach has led to situations where it can be challenging for administrators to ensure uniform policy enforcement across their organization, particularly in large and complex environments.</p><p>New Behavior\n</p><p>To address these issues, we are altering the behavior so that EWS will only be allowed if both the organization-level and user-level EWSEnabled flags are true. Here's a simplified view of the new logic:</p><table class=\"table table-bordered\"><tbody><tr><td>Organization Level</td><td>&nbsp;User Level</td><td>EWS Requests</td></tr><tr><td>True or &lt;null&gt;</td><td>True or &lt;null&gt;</td><td>Allowed</td></tr><tr><td>True or &lt;null&gt;</td><td>False</td><td>Not Allowed</td></tr><tr><td>False</td><td>True or &lt;null&gt;</td><td>Not Allowed</td></tr><tr><td>False</td><td>False</td><td>Not Allowed</td></tr></tbody></table><p>In short, EWS will be permitted only if both the organization and user-level allow it. This change ensures that administrators have better control over EWS access and can enforce policies more consistently across their entire organization</p><p><b>Next Steps:</b>\n</p><p>Please check the blog for additional information and ensure your per-user and tenant wide settings are correct before this change is made to your tenant. \n</p><ul><li>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aka.ms/EWSEnabledChange\" target=\"_blank\">The way to control EWS usage in Exchange Online is changing</a>&nbsp;</li></ul><p><b><br></b></p>",

No admin action is required to initiate the change, and it is not possible to opt-out of this change.<br></li><li>Admins need to prepare for this change because the old URL may be saved in bookmarks, linked from intranet pages, or configured in network devices like proxies. We will indefinitely redirect URLs to the new domain ensuring uninterrupted access in many cases, but you must review any domain usage specific to your environment. It is not possible for us to identify all places within your environment where redirections may not function correctly. Users may initially need to refresh their browsers to receive the redirect if they are using Viva Engage once the change occurs.</li><li>Most attention is required to other usage of the old domain which may be hardcoded in a network proxy or security system. It is not possible for Microsoft to identify instances like these which exist inside your environment.

No admin action is required to initiate the change, and it is not possible to opt-out of this change.</li><li>Preparation for this change will depend on how you use the sender domain. If you have made specific customizations for the old domain in the past, then you may need to replicate the change for the new domain. If the old domain has been configured in transport rules, or an email gateway, then the new domain will need to be added. End users may need to update rules in Outlook. The impact will depend upon how you use the sender domain, so you will need to review your mail configuration and communicate with end users.</li><li>This change may go unnoticed by most users unless they have specific Outlook rules based on the sender domain.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://support.microsoft.com/office/manage-email-messages-by-using-rules-c24f5dea-9465-4df4-ad17-a50704d66c59\" target=\"_blank\">Outlook rules can be updated</a> to use the new domain without admin intervention, but you will need to communicate that the change is coming. <i>Moving to engage.mail.microsoft eliminates the need for yammer.com rules.

Classic Outlook and new Outlook are turned on in the new default configuration, and new Outlook will be added as \"on\" for existing configurations unless administrators edit to exclude it. In case new Outlook is not needed yet, administrators need to specifically edit their configurations to exclude the new Outlook app in the configuration before new installations.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:7.5pt;margin-left:0in\">If administrators have blocked the \"try the new Outlook\" toggle in classic Outlook, that policy will not be affected by these configuration changes or installs of new Outlook. If users install new Outlook alongside classic, they will see new Outlook in the apps list in the Start menu and can use it side by side the classic app if desired.\n</p><p style=\"margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:7.5pt;margin-left:0in\">In case new Outlook was installed and is not needed later, Administrators can continue to remove new Outlook at any time after it has been installed:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoft-365-apps/outlook/get-started/control-install\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"font-family: sans-serif; font-weight: 400; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\">Control the installation and use of new Outlook</a>.</p><p style=\"margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:7.5pt;margin-left:0in\">More details are available in the updated associated documentation here: <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoft-365-apps/outlook/get-started/deployment-new-outlook\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); font-family: sans-serif; font-weight: 400;\">Deployment overview for new Outlook for Windows</a>.</p>",

Currently, when you make metadata changes such as title, description, transcripts, chapters, interactivity, thumbnails, media settings, etc. to files in Microsoft Stream, each of those changes cause new versions to be created. Each of these versions in Microsoft OneDrive and Microsoft SharePoint count the full file size towards consumed storage quota. Thus, for large video and audio files, these versions cause your storage consumption to quickly increase.<br></p><p>To prevent this, we are changing how Microsoft Stream handles versioning. Any changes made specifically to chapters and transcripts of files from Stream will stop making versions, thus preventing storage from increasing as rapidly as it has in the past.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>\n</p><p>This message is associated with Microsoft 365 Roadmap ID <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?filters=&amp;searchterms=395380\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"\">395380</a></p><p><b>When this will happen:</b></p><p>General Availability (Worldwide): We will begin rolling out mid-July 2024 and expect to complete by late August 2024.&nbsp;</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b>\n</p><p>Changes to video and audio files from Stream will no longer take version snapshots.

After this change rolls out, Global admins and Engage admins (also called the <i>Yammer administrator</i> role in Entra ID) will have the ability to perform Viva Engage administration without being assigned a service plan for Viva Engage. \n</p><p>This message is associated with Microsoft 365 Roadmap ID: <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?filters=&amp;searchterms=393230\" target=\"_blank\">393230</a>.\n</p><p><b>When this will happen:</b>\n</p><p>General Availability (Worldwide): We will begin rolling out mid-May 2024 and expect to complete by the mid-June 2024 (previously late May).\n</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b> \n</p><p>Previously when the commonly used <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/viva/engage/manage-engage-licenses-microsoft-365#block-users-who-dont-have-viva-engage-core-licenses\" target=\"_blank\">Block Office 365 users without Yammer licenses</a> option was selected, you needed to assign Engage Core or Yammer Enterprise service plans to Engage admins and global admins to access the Engage website (<a href=\"https://engage.cloud.microsoft\" target=\"_blank\">https://engage.cloud.microsoft</a>), the Engage admin center, or legacy network admin center. After this rollout, license enforcement will not apply to the Global admin or Engage admin roles.\n</p><p>This rollout does not apply to other roles, including Yammer Network Administrator, Yammer Verified Administrator, Corporate Communicator, Answers Administrator, and Community Administrator. These roles will continue to require a “Viva Engage Core” service plan when the tenant is configured to require a per-user license.\n</p><p>Note: Engage admins and Global admins who wish to access Viva Engage inside the Microsoft Teams application should ensure they have access to the right licensing required to access Teams. Learn more about licensing for Teams: <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-teams/teams-products\" target=\"_blank\">All Microsoft Teams Product Plans | Microsoft Teams</a>\n</p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b> \n</p><ul><li>You can choose to unassign the “Viva Engage core” and/or the “Yammer enterprise” service plan from Engage admins/ Global admins, since it’s no longer a prerequisite to access Viva Engage, Engage admin center or the legacy network admin center.\n</li><li>You can also choose to unassign the entire Microsoft 365 seat for these roles if it was earlier assigned for the sole purpose of Viva Engage administration.\n</li><li>Consider using the Engage admin role within Entra ID as more Engage experiences integrate with the rest of Microsoft 365. The Verified Administrator role is internal to Engage and not recognized by applications relying on Entra ID. \n</li></ul><p>This rollout will happen automatically by the specified date with no admin action required before the rollout. You may want to notify your admins about this change and update any relevant documentation as appropriate.\n</p><p>We will update this comm before rollout with revised documentation.</p>",

Using the Power BI <a href=\"https://aka.ms/assessment/infopathreport\" target=\"_blank\">InfoPath Report</a> generated by the scanner tool, you can:</p><ul><li>Identify all InfoPath Forms usage in the tenant, per site collection and site.</li><li>Evaluate the recency and volume of usage of InfoPath Forms.</li><li>Understand lists, libraries and content types that use InfoPath.</li></ul><p>We recommend communicating to the impacted site owners/teams inside your organization now, so they are aware of the coming change.\n</p><p>For scenarios where InfoPath or InfoPath Forms services are currently being used, we recommend migrating to <a href=\"https://powerapps.microsoft.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Power Apps</a>, <a href=\"https://powerautomate.microsoft.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Power Automate</a> or <a href=\"https://forms.office.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Forms</a>.  Please ensure that you allow adequate time for migration of any use of InfoPath/InfoPath Forms Services in your organization ahead of this date, as there is no migration tool provided. Additional instructions on how to migrate can be found in this <a href=\"https://aka.ms/sp-infopath-update\" target=\"_blank\">blog</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Please plan appropriately as there will not be an option to extend InfoPath Form Services beyond the InfoPath retirement date of July 14, 2026.</p>",
