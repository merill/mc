A consistent aspect ratio maintains a more predictable experience when users turn their videos on or off. It also provides more visibility into users' body language and hand gestures.\n</li><li>An audio-video mixed gallery for a more inclusive representation. Audio and video users share now the same space by default.\n</li><li>Meeting rooms are displayed larger than individual participants. In certain meeting sizes, we display Microsoft Teams Rooms video in a larger size than the rest of the participants to give an equivalent weight to participants joining from a meeting room. Non-Teams rooms joining Teams meeting via Direct Guest Join will remain the same tile size as today.\n</li><li>You appear next to the rest of the participants. Your own tile will now be included next to the rest of the participants.\n</li><li>Customization of the gallery. Users can adapt the gallery to their needs or preferences. The customization options include:\n<ul><li>Gallery size: Users can choose the maximum number of tiles that will be represented per page. The entry point for this action is available through the meeting toolbar: \"View\" &gt; \"Change gallery size\".\n</li><li>Placement of your own tile: For users who prefer to keep themselves separated from the rest of the participants. If chosen, the self-tile will be placed in an area separate from the rest of the participants. The entry point for this action is available through the meeting toolbar: \"View\" &gt; \"More options\" &gt; \"Remove me from gallery\".\n</li><li>Prioritizing videos: For users who want to give a higher weight to participants with their video on. If chosen, video participants will be displayed more prominently than audio participants. The entry point for this action is available through the meeting toolbar: \"View\" &gt; \"Prioritize video\".\n</li><li>Meeting room tile size: Users can decide if they want to resize the meeting room tile to the same size as the rest of the participants.

Thank you for your patience.</p><p>If you took action to change or update your email configuration based on the previous communication, then that should remain largely valid. We encourage you to review changes when any updated notice is received.</p><p>As previously communicated in MC561701 (May 2023), a key step in <a href=\"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/viva-engage-blog/yammer-com-rebranded-to-viva-engage/ba-p/3856807\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"\">our rebranding from Yammer to Viva Engage</a> is changing our web and email domains. These changes happen on different schedules and may impact you differently.<br></p><p>Changes to our web domain are currently not anticipated to impact our APIs. Should there be any changes in the future we will notify you.</p><p>This message is associated with Microsoft Roadmap ID <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?filters=&amp;searchterms=180352\" target=\"_blank\">180352</a></p><p>\n</p><p><b>When this will happen:</b><br></p><ul><li>Web domain change: Rollout will begin in late June 2024 (previously late March) and is expected to be complete by mid-July 2024 (previously early April).</li><li>Email domain change: The email sender domain will not start in January 2024 as previously announced. We will send a new notice via message center with 30-days' notice before we start changing the email sender domain later in 2024.</li></ul><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b><br></p><p>Web Domain</p><ul><li>During rollout, the web domain will change for all tenants from https://web.yammer.com to engage.cloud.microsoft. No admin action is required to initiate the change, and it is not possible to opt-out of this change.<br></li><li>Admins need to prepare for this change because the old URL may be saved in bookmarks, linked from intranet pages, or configured in network devices like proxies. We will indefinitely redirect URLs to the new domain ensuring uninterrupted access in many cases, but you must review any domain usage specific to your environment. It is not possible for us to identify all places within your environment where redirections may not function correctly. Users may initially need to refresh their browsers to receive the redirect if they are using Viva Engage once the change occurs.</li><li>Most attention is required to other usage of the old domain which may be hardcoded in a network proxy or security system. It is not possible for Microsoft to identify instances like these which exist inside your environment. IT, network, or security admins inside your organization may be able to help identify instances and plan changes. Check your configuration for desktop and mobile browsers because they may be different.</li></ul><p>Email Domain</p><ul><li><i>The sender domain used in emails from Viva Engage will start changing from @yammer.com to @engage.mail.microsoft.</i> This phased change to emails will continue until all Viva Engage email notifications and digests use the new sender domain. No admin action is required to initiate the change, and it is not possible to opt-out of this change.</li><li>Preparation for this change will depend on how you use the sender domain. If you have made specific customizations for the old domain in the past, then you may need to replicate the change for the new domain. If the old domain has been configured in transport rules, or an email gateway, then the new domain will need to be added. End users may need to update rules in Outlook. The impact will depend upon how you use the sender domain, so you will need to review your mail configuration and communicate with end users.</li><li>This change may go unnoticed by most users unless they have specific Outlook rules based on the sender domain.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://support.microsoft.com/office/manage-email-messages-by-using-rules-c24f5dea-9465-4df4-ad17-a50704d66c59\" target=\"_blank\">Outlook rules can be updated</a> to use the new domain without admin intervention, but you will need to communicate that the change is coming. <i>Moving to engage.mail.microsoft eliminates the need for yammer.com rules. Customers can delete previous rules or modify them for engage.mail.microsoft. Admins should review their email configuration.</i></li></ul><p>Progressive Web App (PWA)<br></p><p>Users will need to re-install after the domain migration is completed in order to continue using the application this can be done through the browser PWA options: <a href=\"https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/9658361?hl=en-GB&amp;co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop#:~:text=Install%20a%20PWA%201%20On%20your%20computer%2C%20open,Follow%20the%20on-screen%20instructions%20to%20install%20the%20PWA.\" target=\"_blank\">Chrome</a>, <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoft-edge/progressive-web-apps-chromium/ux\" target=\"_blank\">Edge</a>&nbsp;and<a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/Progressive_web_apps/Guides/Installing\" target=\"_blank\"> Firefox</a>.</p><p>Desktop Notifications<br></p><p>\n</p><p>\n</p><p>Users who have enabled desktop notifications previously, after the domain migration will have to enable them again in the <a href=\"https://support.microsoft.com/office/manage-viva-engage-desktop-notifications-bf60a88f-23cc-4ee3-b81d-5637b073d1de#:~:text=Enable%20desktop%20notifications%20from%20Viva%20Engage%20on%20the,this%20setting%2C%20and%20turn%20off%20Manage%20desktop%20notifications.\" target=\"_blank\"><i>Settings</i> menu.</a></p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b><br></p><p>Review all places where you might have explicitly configured or hardcoded domain names.

To support your move to Stream (on SharePoint) we have created migration tool that allows you to transfer your videos to SharePoint while also bringing over metadata, links and permissions associated with your videos.\n</p><p>To begin using the migration tool please refer to our 3-part Migration guide here: <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/stream/streamnew/stream-migration-guide-part1\" target=\"_blank\">Guide to migrate data from Stream (Classic) to Stream (on SharePoint) - Part 1</a>\n</p><p>You can also skip tool complexities and finish migration quickly with our 1-day migration guide: <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/stream/streamnew/stream-migration-guide-1-day-migration\" target=\"_blank\">1-day Guide to migrate data from Stream (Classic) to Stream (on SharePoint)</a></p><p><b>How this affects your organization:</b>\n</p><p>Stream (on SharePoint) brings your users many of the capabilities of Stream (Classic) while allowing them to record and play videos directly in many everyday work and school apps such as Teams, Office.com, Yammer, Viva, PowerPoint, and SharePoint. In addition, Stream (on SharePoint) also enables you and your users to:\n</p><ul><li>Easily manage video files with the same security, admin controls, multi-geo support, compliance (eDiscovery, legal hold, retention, and data loss prevention policies), permissions, and sharing controls as the rest of your files in SharePoint and OneDrive.\n</li><li>Record videos with advanced tools directly in the camera like background blur or replace, inking, text, audio only, and teleprompter.\n</li><li>Search for videos anywhere in Microsoft 365. You can now find videos and Teams meeting recordings across Microsoft 365 by searching keywords.\n</li><li>Find what you need quickly on the Stream start page in Office. The new start page shows recent, shared, and favorite videos, with playlists coming soon. (Note: The Stream start page doesn't show you videos in Stream (Classic).)\n</li><li>View Teams Meeting Recordings with transcripts, chapters, timeline markers, speaker attribution, and comments.\n</li><li>Create custom page, site, and portal experiences to feature videos as part of your intranet and Viva Connections.\n</li><li>Share videos the same way you would any other file in Microsoft 365 with support for Guests, People in your Organization links, or unauthenticated external sharing with “anyone” links.\n</li><li>Get analytics per video, for all the videos in a site, or see who has watched your video.\n</li><li>Add videos to the Viva Connections Feed.\n</li><li>Use APIs based on the Microsoft Graph Files API for basic video file operations.\n</li><li>These benefits add up to ease of video management for admins and more productivity for your teams.</li></ul>",

The dashboard access controls are managed by Global admins. \n</p><p>Note: The measured population consists of the people in your company—called measured employees—whose Microsoft 365 collaboration activity you want to analyze. Some organizations choose to analyze the entire population, while others use population subsets for specific analysis scenarios.

Users can apply filters to customize the groups they want to compare.\n</li><li>Viva Insights admins can upload survey data in CSV format through the advanced insights app. Leader users can view the uploaded sentiment results in the Copilot Dashboard.

Microsoft Teams Android devices will be migrating to this platform. The first step in the migration is a firmware update to Microsoft Teams Android devices in 2024. The firmware update will move devices from Android device administrator to Android AOSP management.<br></p><p><b>When this will happen:</b></p><p>A Preview program for select Microsoft Teams Android devices is targeted for Q2 of calendar year 2024. General release of the firmware update with the Android AOSP management stack will happen later in Q3 of calendar year 2024 for all eligible Microsoft Teams Android devices.</p><p>Eligible Microsoft Teams Android devices will initially receive a manual firmware update in Teams Admin Center so IT admins can manually verify the migration on their own schedule on select devices of their choosing.</p><p>Eventually, the firmware update for migration will be scheduled as an automatic firmware update in Teams Admin Center. This automatic firmware update can be deferred for up to 90 days from first availability based upon the admin configured stages in Teams Admin Center.\n</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b></p><p>The firmware upgrade, including the support for Intune management of Android (AOSP) devices must be accepted. It can be deferred for up to 90 days after it is first available. This can be done in the same way as other firmware upgrades in Teams Admin Center.\n</p><p>Devices will continue to remain signed in after the firmware upgrade.\n</p><p>Certain legacy devices will not receive the firmware upgrade for Android (AOSP) management in Intune. These devices will continue using Device Administrator.\n</p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b>\n</p><p>Policies will not be migrated automatically between Android device administrator and Android (AOSP) platforms. IT admins will need to create the appropriate new policies under the Intune Android (AOSP) platform to support their Microsoft Teams Android Devices. \n</p><p>This will need to be done before taking the firmware update for a successful migration. \n</p><p>More details on enabling support and creating enrollment profiles and policies for Intune AOSP will follow closer to the start of Preview.</p>",

Once the devices are on the same version, they will be updated to the new version together. In this scenario, the move to the new version may be delayed as the parity updates will happen first.

The ability to create a new post or reply to an existing post directly using email will be retired from Viva Engage starting on March 31st, 2024. Interactive emails in Outlook provide the richest way to stay engaged in Viva Engage conversations, polls, questions, and praise, without leaving the Outlook inbox.<br></p><p>Historically, users could create new posts in a Viva Engage community by sending an email to a specific email address for that community. Additionally, users can reply to an existing post via an email sent to that conversation. These flows will stop working. Users must instead utilize one of the options listed below for their scenario. &nbsp;</p><p>If users attempt to post in a community or reply to an existing community post via email after the feature is disabled, they will receive an email notification explaining that the feature is no longer available. All other email related Engage features will remain unaffected. Community posts will still generate email notifications, and users will still be able to reply and react to posts using the Viva Engage Web, Mobile, Teams, and Outlook interactive email experiences. &nbsp;</p><p> </p><p><b>When will this happen:</b></p><p>Retirement will begin in late March 2024 and is expected to complete by late May 2024. We will not be providing extensions for continued use of these retired features. </p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b></p><p>If your organization makes heavy use of post to Viva Engage by sending an email message, they will be impacted by this change and may need to alter business processes. However, we expect minimal impact from this change for most customers.</p><p>After the feature is retired, users can expect to receive a bounce back email with deprecation information if they attempt to create a post by sending an email to the community email address. Additionally, they will receive a similar bounce back email if they attempt to reply to an existing post via email. </p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b></p><p>Whether admin action is required depends upon how the post by email feature is being used in an organization. Most customers will have no action beyond reviewing internal help of guidance that may have been created for end users.</p><p>Admins can use the following examples to identify usage and key stakeholders within their organization, but other scenarios may exist:   </p><ul><li>If you are using an email client such as Outlook as a free form editing experience to create rich media posts, the new Viva Engage <a href=\"https://admin.microsoft.com/Adminportal/Home?source=applauncher#/MessageCenter?id=MC712149\" target=\"_blank\">Articles</a> feature is the best alternative.  &nbsp;</li><li>When Delayed Delivery in Outlook is used to schedule when posts are sent to a community, the new Viva Engage <a href=\"https://support.microsoft.com/topic/save-and-schedule-drafts-to-post-later-in-viva-engage-dc806ad9-73bb-49ae-9c68-d800fd902649\" target=\"_blank\">Scheduled Posts</a>  is the best alternative, as it allows scheduling announcements and posts when the audiences are most active. &nbsp;</li><li>Automatic posting workflows may be set up to post new messages, or reply to posts, through email from outside applications. These need to be reviewed and changed to use alternative mechanisms. Posting is possible through the Viva Engage <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/rest/api/yammer/messages-json-post\" target=\"_blank\">REST API</a> and <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/connectors/yammer/\" target=\"_blank\">Power Platform</a>, but admins will need to identify the appropriate solution and make changes for each scenario.</li></ul>",

Thank you for your patience.</p><p>Soon, on Windows and macOS devices running the OneDrive sync app, we will enable a new feature called “Offline mode” that will allow you to continue working with the OneDrive web app in your browser, OneDrive PWA (Progressive Web App) or Microsoft Teams even when you are offline. This feature will be on by default and will give your users the ability to view, rename, move, copy their files, and create new folders when offline. Users will be able to open their files that are available offline on users’ device in a native app directly from inside OneDrive on the web. All of the metadata changes users make offline to their files in the browser will be automatically synced back to OneDrive when Internet connection is restored, and users can resolve conflicts, if there are any. As an administrator, you’ll be able to control various aspects of Offline mode using the Group Policies outlined in <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/sharepoint/use-group-policy\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.</p><p>When this feature becomes enabled for users in your organization and the user then visits OneDrive for web, Offline mode will be set up for the first time. A copy of user’s file metadata that powers OneDrive for web is securely stored locally on user’s device. These data on user’s device are only available and accessible by that user. If someone else were to sign in on your device, these local data on the device wouldn't be available to them.<br></p><p>A secure local web server on user’s device will handle the operations that users perform on their files in OneDrive for web, such as viewing, sorting, renaming, moving, and copying where traditionally these operations would need to be handled by the OneDrive cloud service. This allows to eliminate network as the bottleneck when loading and working with OneDrive for web resulting in fast and smooth interactions with users’ files like loading your files and folders, sorting, renaming, moving, renaming, and more. And all of these operations will continue to work even when users are offline, lose internet connection, or run into a service disruption.<br></p><ul><li>OneDrive Offline mode lets you work on OneDrive when offline in the browser, OneDrive PWA (Progressive Web App) and in Microsoft Teams, improves performance on all kinds of networks, and helps alleviate throttling related to working with large file collections.</li><li>OneDrive Offline mode is currently supported on Windows devices (Windows 10 or later) and macOS devices (macOS 12 Monterey or later) that have the OneDrive sync app installed and on Chromium-based browsers (Microsoft Edge, Google Chrome)<br></li><li>Offline mode will be on by default for user’s OneDrive on the web and both users and administrators will have the option to disable Offline mode for their OneDrive.<br></li><li>Offline mode is a per-device setting (configured separately for every device users use to access OneDrive on the web.<br></li><li>The data is securely stored in a local database under the user’s profile directory and requests are handled through a secure localhost HTTP server.

Thank you for your patience.</p><p>Non-Native and Hybrid Yammer Networks will be upgraded to Native Mode to allow users, groups, and content to be compatible with and mapped to their counterparts in Azure Active Directory and Microsoft 365. Native Mode also provides other benefits, such as the ability to host Live Events in every Yammer community and simplify file administration through SharePoint. Most critically, Native Mode supports eDiscovery through the Microsoft Purview compliance portal, allowing your organization to collaborate safely and securely within your Yammer network. 90% of Yammer networks are in Native Mode today, including our top 10 largest networks.<br></p><p><b>When this will happen:</b></p><p>We will begin migrating networks on December 01, 2022, and continue the upgrades through late December 2024 (previously January). The process will begin with smaller networks. If you prefer to control the timing of your upgrade, you may initiate the process on your own at any time by visiting the Microsoft 365 Native Mode page within the Network Admin pages of Yammer.\n</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b></p><p>You will lose access to the following features:\n</p><ul><li>Network-level guests \n</li><li>Email blocked lists\n</li><li>Secret groups\n</li></ul><p>If your organization has active guest users, <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/yammer/get-started-with-yammer/azure-ad-b2b-guests-yammer\" target=\"_blank\">Azure Active Directory B2B guest functionality</a> can be used for guests who reside in the same geography as the Yammer network (US guests for US networks; EU guests for EU networks). Guests will need to be reinvited to your network.\n</p><p>If your organization currently uses an email blocked list to manage access to your Yammer network, you can continue to manage access from the Azure Active Directory Portal.

There is no feature equivalent to secret groups in Microsoft 365; all groups must be public or private.\n</p><p>As part of the migration process, the Yammer administrator account will be added to all groups in the network, and files may be renamed.\n</p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b></p><p><i>If you would like to self-initiate your migration:\n</i></p><ul><li>There is a <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/yammer/configure-your-yammer-network/native-mode-step-by-step-guide\" target=\"_blank\">step-by-step guide to Native Mode migration</a> available. You can run an alignment report that will identify gaps in your current network alignment with Native Mode.

While these accounts offer web and mobile only access to Microsoft 365 apps and services, they could previously be added as secondary accounts to the classic desktop versions of the Microsoft 365 apps when an another account that includes desktop install rights (e.g. Enterprise E3, Business Standard) was already added.&nbsp;</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b></p><p>If you have users in your organization that are setup with multiple email accounts with different licenses, they may now be able to access both accounts in the new Outlook for Windows like they did previously in the classic Outlook for Windows.&nbsp;</p><p>The user will need to first add the account that includes a license for the Outlook &amp; Microsoft 365 desktop apps (e.g. Enterprise E3, Business Standard).

Task publishing is available in Microsoft Teams as part of the <i>Tasks by Planner and To Do</i>&nbsp;app, which will soon be renamed to <i>Planner</i>.</p><p>We're releasing several new task publishing features based on top customer requests and feedback:&nbsp;</p><ol><li><b>Recurring task lists</b>. You'll be able to set recurrence on a draft task list, which will allow you to choose the cadence (such as every month on the 15th of the month). You can then publish the list and task publishing will automatically send future tasks. We know this will be a time saver for distributing repeat tasks across frontline locations. Common applications are weekly/monthly site inspections and compliance walks or daily opening and closing tasks.\n</li><li><b>Training and policy task lists. </b>You'll be able to create a task list for each member of a recipient team. When you publish the list and choose the recipient teams, a copy of the tasks in the list will be created for and assigned to each member of the recipient teams. This is a great option for training tasks or tasks where employees must acknowledge a new policy.</li><li><b>Form completion requirement.</b>&nbsp;You'll be able to add a form completion requirement to a task, which allows you to create a Microsoft Forms survey that must be completed by a member of each recipient team before that team can complete the task.&nbsp;You can use any Forms question types, including a question that requires a file upload for employees to show their work. You'll be able to centrally review the form submissions across the locations.</li><li><b>Approval completion requirement.&nbsp;</b>Similarly, you'll be able to add an approval completion requirement to a task, which means that the task cannot be approved until an approval of the completed work is requested and granted. The approval can be requested directly from the task details by the user completing the task.&nbsp;</li></ol><p>These features will be enabled as part of the rollout of the new Planner experience (more info at&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aka.ms/thenewplanner\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"font-family: sans-serif; font-weight: 400; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\">https://aka.ms/thenewplanner</a>).</p><p>This message is associated with Microsoft 365 Roadmap ID <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?filters=&amp;searchterms=135562\" target=\"_blank\">135562</a>.</p>\n<p><b>When this will happen:</b></p>\n\n<p>Targeted Release: We will begin rolling out mid-March and expect to complete by late March 2024.<br></p><p>Standard Release: We will begin rolling out late March 2024 and expect to complete by early April 2024.</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b><br></p>\n\n<p>If you are using the task publishing feature, you will see new options when creating task lists and tasks.</p><ul><li>For recurrence options when working with a draft list, you can select <i>Does not recur </i>next to the list title to change the recurrence setting (Screenshot 1 below).</li><li>You'll see the option to create a task list for each team member when you click the <i>New list</i> button (Screenshot 2 below).</li><li>You'll see the option to add a form completion requirement or approval completion requirement to a task after you've created a task in the draft task list.

First, admins can set a default value for new apps that are published to the Teams app store. Second, admins can manage apps for users, groups, or everyone in the organization.

The app status from the permission policy and tenant settings will be migrated to preserve the admin intent. The migration will not affect the end users and their ability to use the apps. Admins may see the Manage apps page in a read-only mode for a short time.\n</p><p><i>Phase 2</i><b> </b>(more details coming soon as a follow up MC post) affects the tenants that use both global and custom app permission policies. This phase will let the admin choose to migrate to app centric management by following a migration process that will change the existing app permission policies to app assignments in the new app centric model. The admins will have the choice to modify the apps that are assigned using the custom permission policies to be accessible to groups, if they want.\n</p><p><i>Phase 3</i> (more details coming soon as a follow up MC post) applies to the tenants that skipped the migration in phase 1 or 2. These tenants will be migrated automatically in this phase.</p>\n\n<p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b></p>\n\n<p>Starting with this release, you can:\n</p><p>1.\tManage Teams apps for selected set of users, groups or all users in the organization. \n</p><p><img src=\"https://img-prod-cms-rt-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/cms/api/am/imageFileData/RW1eEle?ver=d0d1\" style=\"width: 400px;\"><img src=\"https://img-prod-cms-rt-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/cms/api/am/imageFileData/RW1ezbo?ver=7bcc\" style=\"width: 400px;\"></p><p>2.\tSet the default value for new apps published to Teams app store for each of the app types: Microsoft, third-party and custom apps. \n</p><p><img src=\"https://img-prod-cms-rt-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/cms/api/am/imageFileData/RW1eBMn?ver=12ca\" style=\"width: 400px;\"><br></p>\n\n<p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b><br></p>\n<p>No action needed for phase 1 tenants with Global permission policy only.

When a user clicks on a highlighted entity, Outlook shows a list of add-ins that are relevant to that entity. </p><p>Regex matching is a process where Outlook matches the content of a message against a set of regular expressions provided by the add-in developer.

However, we will continue to support regex matching in add-ins and the Join Meeting button in online meeting add-ins.</p><p>If you have any add-ins that use entity stamping, you’ll need to update them to use regex matching or the Join Meeting button prior to this change happening. Otherwise, your add-ins won’t activate in Outlook and may lose functionality.</p><p>As part of this retirement, the following APIs will stop working for add-ins:</p><ul><li>getEntities()</li><li>getEntitiesByType(entityType)&nbsp;</li><li>getFilteredEntitiesByName(name)&nbsp;</li><li>getSelectedEntities()&nbsp;</li></ul><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b></p><p>To learn how to update your add-ins, see <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/office/dev/add-ins/outlook/use-regular-expressions-to-show-an-outlook-add-in\" target=\"_blank\">Use regular expression activation rules to show an Outlook add-in</a> and <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/office/dev/add-ins/outlook/online-meeting?tabs=non-mobile\" target=\"_blank\">Create an Outlook add-in for an online-meeting provider.</a> For more details on the announcement, see <a href=\"https://devblogs.microsoft.com/microsoft365dev/retirement-of-entity-based-contextual-outlook-add-ins/\" target=\"_blank\">Retirement of entity-based contextual Outlook add-ins</a>.</p><p>\n</p>",

For example, admins can configure the indicator <i>Sending email with attachments to recipients outside the organization</i> to only detect emails sent to personal domains (such as outlook.com). In this way, admins can reduce the number of false positives.</p>\n<p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b></p>\n<p>No action is needed to prepare for this rollout. To use granular exclusions, admins can configure the exclusion conditions in the Purview compliance portal at <i>Insider risk settings &gt; policy indicators</i> and select indicators to create variants of detections. You may want to notify your users about this change and update any relevant documentation as appropriate.</p><p>Microsoft Purview Insider Risk Management correlates various signals to identify potential malicious or inadvertent insider risks, such as IP theft, data leakage, and security violations. Insider Risk Management enables customers to create policies based on their own internal policies, governance, and organizational requirements.

      "Content": "<p>Updated February 8, 2024: We have updated the rollout timeline below. Thank you for your patience.</p><p>This post summarizes a change when browsing online address books in Exchange Online.&nbsp; Recently, Microsoft made a change to improve performance and encourage users to use search instead of infinite browsing. This change impacts browsing in any online address list with more than 500 objects and applies to the Default Global Address List, built-in address lists, and custom address lists. The change does not affect browsing Offline Address Books.<br></p><p>\n</p><p><b>When this will happen:</b><br></p><p>This change has started rolling and is expected to complete by mid-February 2024 (previously late January).</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b><br></p><p>In Outlook, opening an online address book is limited to showing the first 500 users if the result set exceeds 500 objects. To find a specific user or set of users with similar names, you can use the existing search functionality in Outlook. The behavior when searching based on \"All columns\" is unchanged. Search continues to return results if the criteria produces a matching result set of less than 5000 objects (by checking for partial matches in DisplayName, FirstName, LastName, Alias, and CommonName). If the result set exceeds 5000 objects, no results are displayed and a message encourages you to narrow your search criteria. Searches based on \"Name Only\" now behave consistently with searches based on All columns. The only difference with Name Only is the criteria is naturally based only on the name value. Searches based on \"Name Only\" no longer allow unlimited browsing of the entire address list as they did previously.&nbsp; This change does not impact browsing offline address books.</p><p>In Outlook on the web, users are already directed to use search and suggestions provided by the search engine. However, if a user selects the To: button in a draft email, they are able to view an online address list. If the online address list contains more than 500 users, no results are shown. A message directs the user to find the desired recipient using search instead. Also, the People Hub in Outlook on the web now requires a search criteria to display any users. Users automatically get a corresponding message when they navigate to view an address list.</p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b></p><p>You may want to inform your end users of the new behavior. When using online address books, Microsoft recommends users rely on search. Users can enter basic search criteria (exact match not required) and view all matching results provided the matching result set is &lt;=5000 objects.</p><p>For users that wish to continue using existing browse behavior for address books with more than 500 objects, users should use the offline address book.</p>",

Thank you for your patience.</p><p style=\"\">The customization control in the Viva Pulse Admin Experience will soon be managed through centralized feature access management in Viva through PowerShell. This customization control provides admins the ability to turn on or off customization capabilities for survey authors to add their own questions to existing stock templates or edit existing stock questions. With centralized feature access management, admins can configure access at the tenant level, group level (using AAD groups or M365 Groups), or at the user level, for maximum flexibility.&nbsp;<br></p>\n<p><b>When this will happen:</b></p>\n\n<p>These changes are expected to be completed by late February 2024 (previously mid-January).&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b></p><ul><li>At the end of October, the two customization controls will be consolidated to one customization control called ‘Survey question customization’. The value currently set for the “New questions” control will be the value of the new consolidated customization control. Management of the control will change to PowerShell configurations through <a href=\"https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2245618\" target=\"_blank\">centralized feature access management</a>. The UX for this control in the Viva Pulse Admin Experience will be removed. \n</li><li>For any tenant that has previously disabled the customization control, you will have a policy assigned to everyone in the tenant that maintains that disabled state. The admin can then manage/edit/delete that policy after the migration. \n</li></ul><p>Admins will soon be able to manage the customization feature control for their specific users, groups, or the entire tenant by using PowerShell. Use the Add-VivaModuleFeaturePolicy cmdlet to create a new access policy to disable customization in Viva Pulse. The attributes of the policy are defined using specific parameters of the cmdlet. Policies are used to restrict or grant access to the specified feature for specific users, groups, or the entire tenant.\n</p><p>For more information about the PowerShell cmdlets and detailed instructions on how to create a policy, please review: \n</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/exchange/add-vivamodulefeaturepolicy?view=exchange-ps\" target=\"_blank\">Add-VivaModuleFeaturePolicy (ExchangePowerShell) | Microsoft Learn</a></li><li><a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/exchange/get-vivamodulefeaturepolicy?view=exchange-ps\" target=\"_blank\">Get-VivaModuleFeaturePolicy (ExchangePowerShell) | Microsoft Learn</a></li><li><a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/exchange/remove-vivamodulefeaturepolicy?view=exchange-ps\" target=\"_blank\">Remove-VivaModuleFeaturePolicy (ExchangePowerShell) | Microsoft Learn</a></li><li><a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/exchange/update-vivamodulefeaturepolicy?view=exchange-ps\" target=\"_blank\">Update-VivaModuleFeaturePolicy (ExchangePowerShell) | Microsoft Learn</a></li></ul>\n<p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b></p>\n<p>Review and assess the impact on your organization.

Once this restriction is enabled, meeting chat participants will not be able to copy chat messages using menu options or keyboard shortcuts, or forward or share messages to Outlook. There is also a new Meeting Policy setting in Teams admin center for admin to control whether users can see or use this feature in the Meeting Options page. Admins can also set the default value for this meeting option in Meeting Templates that they create.

To ensure a smooth transition and prevent any potential disruptions to your workflows, we find it necessary to adjust our original timeline.<br></p><p>The new release date for the web domain migration is now set to begin in late March. This decision has been made to safeguard your experience and minimize any potential negative impacts on your daily work. We apologize for any effect that this delay may have caused you.\n</p><p>This message is associated with Microsoft 365 Roadmap ID <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?filters=&amp;searchterms=180352\" target=\"_blank\">180352</a>.</p><p><b>When this will happen:</b><br></p><p>Standard Release: We will begin rolling out in late March 2024 and expect to complete by early April 2024. We can't give you an exact date for when the change will roll out to your tenant.&nbsp;</p><p>We understand the importance of your workflows. By delaying the release, we can thoroughly test and validate the changes to help guarantee a seamless transition. We ask you to continue following our previous recommendations to prepare for this change, as they remain applicable.</p><p>It's important to note that these release dates are only for the web domain migration. The email sender domain change has not yet been rescheduled. We will announce updates on the email sender domain changes in a future message center post.</p><p>We sincerely appreciate your ongoing support and patience as we work diligently to ensure that this change does not disrupt your daily work.</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b></p><p>We will redirect URLs from the old domain (https://web.yammer.com) to the new domain (https://engage.cloud.microsoft/) to ensure uninterrupted access to Viva Engage and related features. These redirects will work with supported browsers and will be retained for the long term, so items like bookmarks should transition seamlessly. Users who are in Viva Engage at the same time as the change rolls out may need to refresh their browsers once to be redirected to the new domain.&nbsp;</p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b></p><p>Review all places where you may have explicitly configured or hardcoded domain names. Share this information on the domain changes with the relevant admins to give them time to make the necessary changes. Use any changes you have implemented for the old domain as a guide to what you may need to implement for the new domain.  \n</p><p>While these changes are not anticipated to affect our APIs, it is possible that the old domain is hardcoded in a custom application, script, or automation–possibly in an unsupported manner. Review your usage of custom applications and contact your developer or partner for updates.</p><p>Learn more about the rebranding: <a href=\"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/viva-engage-blog/yammer-is-evolving-to-viva-engage/ba-p/3738825#:~:text=In%202023%2C%20all%20of%20Yammer%20will%20evolve%20to,will%20be%20updated%20to%20reflect%20Viva%20Engage%20branding\" target=\"_blank\">Yammer is evolving to Viva Engage - Microsoft Community Hub</a></p>",

Stream (Classic) has already been auto disabled for end users, and admins can delay this change till the retirement date. Admins must migrate their tenant's Stream (Classic) data to Stream (on SharePoint) before the retirement date to prevent data loss.\n</p><p>Stream (Classic)'s successor service, Stream (on SharePoint), entered general availability in October 2022. We recommend that you:\n</p><ul><li>begin using Stream (on SharePoint)\n</li><li>direct your users to upload videos to SharePoint, Teams, OneDrive, and Yammer\n</li><li>put a plan in place for migration.\n</li></ul><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b>\n</p><p>Migrating your content from Stream (Classic):\n</p><p>All your existing Stream (Classic) videos can be transferred to Stream (on SharePoint) to take advantage of Stream’s rich integration within Microsoft 365. To support your move to Stream (on SharePoint) we have created migration tool that allows you to transfer your videos to SharePoint while also bringing over metadata, links and permissions associated with your videos.\n</p><p>To begin using the migration tool please refer to our 3-part Migration guide here: <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/stream/streamnew/stream-migration-guide-part1\" target=\"_blank\">Guide to migrate data from Stream (Classic) to Stream (on SharePoint) - Part 1</a></p><p>You can also skip tool complexities and finish migration quickly with our 1-day migration guide: <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/stream/streamnew/stream-migration-guide-1-day-migration\" target=\"_blank\">1-day Guide to migrate data from Stream (Classic) to Stream (on SharePoint)</a></p><p><b>How this affects your organization:</b>\n</p><p>Stream (on SharePoint) brings your users many of the capabilities of Stream (Classic) while allowing them to record and play videos directly in many everyday work and school apps such as Teams, Office.com, Yammer, Viva, PowerPoint, and SharePoint. In addition, Stream (on SharePoint) also enables you and your users to:\n</p><ul><li>Easily manage video files with the same security, admin controls, multi-geo support, compliance (eDiscovery, legal hold, retention, and data loss prevention policies), permissions, and sharing controls as the rest of your files in SharePoint and OneDrive.\n</li><li>Record videos with advanced tools directly in the camera like background blur or replace, inking, text, audio only, and teleprompter.\n</li><li>Search for videos anywhere in Microsoft 365. You can now find videos and Teams meeting recordings across Microsoft 365 by searching keywords.\n</li><li>Find what you need quickly on the Stream start page in Office. The new start page shows recent, shared, and favorite videos, with playlists coming soon. (Note: The Stream start page doesn't show you videos in Stream (Classic).)\n</li><li>View Teams Meeting Recordings with transcripts, chapters, timeline markers, speaker attribution, and comments.\n</li><li>Create custom page, site, and portal experiences to feature videos as part of your intranet and Viva Connections.\n</li><li>Share videos the same way you would any other file in Microsoft 365 with support for Guests, People in your Organization links, or unauthenticated external sharing with “anyone” links.\n</li><li>Get analytics per video, for all the videos in a site, or see who has watched your video.\n</li><li>Add videos to the Viva Connections Feed.\n</li><li>Use APIs based on the Microsoft Graph Files API for basic video file operations.\n</li><li>These benefits add up to ease of video management for admins and more productivity for your teams.</li></ul>",

After the pre-selection period ends March 4, 2024, Teams admins also can adjust these settings. Your current Team and Chat RSC settings will not be affected during this preselection period. The new policies will gradually start taking effect on March 7, 2024 and will completely roll out to all tenants by March 14, 2024. When rolled out, the new settings will take on a new ManagedByMicrosoft state. Instructions for modifying the new teams-specific consent settings can be found in the <i>Configure consent settings</i> section of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/platform/graph-api/rsc/grant-resource-specific-consent#configure-consent-settings\" target=\"_blank\">Grant RSC permissions to an app - Teams | Microsoft Learn</a>.</p>",

Thank you for your feedback.</p><p>Microsoft will stop honoring the mail flow rule which helps you track end user reporting. To improve the availability and reduce the latency of the submission service so that you can respond to threats (false negatives) more quickly and efficiently, we moved the submission service ahead of the exchange transport rule agent. Now the mail flow rules (or exchange transport rules) which you have for the following addresses – phish@office365.microsoft.com, junk@office365.microsoft.com, not_junk@office365.microsoft.com, phish@senpluspluseop.onmicrosoft.com, unjunk@senpluspluseop.onmicrosoft.com and  junk@senpluspluseop.onmicrosoft.com won’t be honored as the agent won't be receiving signals for these addresses. \n</p><p>Moreover, the message tracking logs will show that reports going to phish@office365.microsoft.com, junk@office365.microsoft.com and not_junk@office365.microsoft.com as deleted or failed. </p><p>For example: <b>{LED=550 4.3.2 QUEUE.TransportAgent; message deleted by transport agent};{MSG=};{FQDN=};{IP=};{LRT=}</b>. Please ignore it as it is by design while we look for a better way to address it.</p><p><b>When this will happen:</b></p><p>We'll be gradually rolling this out to customers starting late December 2023 and the roll out will be completed by mid-February 2024 (previously late January).</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b></p><p>You will no longer be able to track end user report using mail flow rules for the following addresses – phish@office365.microsoft.com, junk@office365.microsoft.com, not_junk@office365.microsoft.com once the change is implemented.</p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b><br></p><p>If you are routing report messages to a mailbox, we recommend going to <a href=\"https://security.microsoft.com/securitysettings/userSubmission\" target=\"_blank\">user reported settings</a> and under \"reported message destinations\", setting the \"send reported messages\" to \"My reporting mailbox only\" and then providing the mailbox address you are routing to. Distribution groups and routing to an external or on-premises mailbox aren't allowed.</p><p>If you are routing report messages to a mailbox for a particular report type, take the above step and <a href=\"https://support.microsoft.com/office/manage-email-messages-by-using-rules-c24f5dea-9465-4df4-ad17-a50704d66c59\" target=\"_blank\">create rules in the mailbox using the outlook client</a>. You can specify which report \"phish\" or \"junk\" or \"not junk\", you want to be ignored and filtered from your view. The report type is specified in the subject of the notification email sent to the mailbox (1| for Junk,  2| for Not junk, 3| for Phishing).\n</p><p>If you are concerned that your phish simulations will get analyzed by Microsoft, please add the third party phish simulation tool as <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/security/office-365-security/advanced-delivery-policy-configure?view=o365-worldwide\" target=\"_blank\">phish simulation under advanced delivery</a>. With this change, the phish simulation will get delivered unfiltered and on user report, it won’t be analyzed by Microsoft. It will even show up as a phish simulation in the <a href=\"https://sip.security.microsoft.com/reportsubmission?viewid=user\" target=\"_blank\">user report tab</a> of submissions.\n</p><p>If you are using exchange transport rule to forward phish simulation from user report to third party tool, we recommend going to <a href=\"https://sip.security.microsoft.com/securitysettings/userSubmission\" target=\"_blank\">user reported settings</a> and under \"reported message destinations\", setting the \"send reported messages\" to \"Microsoft and My reporting mailbox only\" or “My reporting mailbox only”. Then provide a mailbox address you want the user report to route to (not the third party mailbox). Distribution groups and routing to an external or on-premises mailbox aren't allowed for this address. Now you configure an exchange transport rule which forward phish simulation coming to this mailbox address to the third-party tool.\n</p><p>If you are routing report messages to Microsoft via a custom add-in or another mechanism, we recommend either using the report button in Outlook for web or the report message add-in or the report phish add-in as described <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/security/office-365-security/submissions-users-report-message-add-in-configure?\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); font-family: sans-serif; font-weight: 400;\">here</a>.&nbsp;<br></p>",

URBAC is currently in opt-in mode.&nbsp;<br>The new Service Plan has no impact on your organization.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b></p>\n<p>Microsoft Defender XDR unified role-based access control (URBAC) provides an alternative to traditional Microsoft Defender for Office 365 (MDO/EOP) and Exchange Online (EXO) RBAC.  By default, there are no changes to your security portal permissions.  If you want to enable Unified RBAC, then you must first configure the new URBAC roles for your organization. Once you have configured these roles, then you can enable use of URBAC for ‘Microsoft Defender for Office’ permissions and/or ‘Exchange Online’ permissions.  Doing so replaces your existing RBAC with the new roles.  You can find more information over here - <a href=\"https://aka.ms/M365DRBAC\" target=\"_blank\">Microsoft 365 Defender Unified role-based access control (RBAC) | Microsoft Learn</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Unified RBAC provides an import roles wizard which will help migrate the permissions from your Microsoft Defender for Office 365 role groups.  It will create URBAC role groups with permissions that mirror the legacy permissions and groups you have already set up.  It will not migrate/replicate Exchange Online permissions – these will require manual configuration in URBAC role groups.&nbsp;</p><p>Please note that URBAC will continue to respect existing Microsoft Entra global roles when you activate the Microsoft Defender XDR Unified RBAC model for Defender for Office 365. i.e. Global Admins and Security Admins will retain assigned admin privileges.</p>",

Thank you for your patience.</p><p>With the launch of Collaborative Notes, we’re also improving the shareable link type that is created by Collaborative Notes to help make meetings more effective and secure. The new Collaborative Notes file will now support a Specific people link which offers more controlled access than People in your organization link. This change will automatically align the Collaborative Notes file link type with <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepoint/change-default-sharing-link\" target=\"_blank\">customer's default setup</a>.

Thank you for your patience.</p><p style=\"\">Currently, users experience some frustration when using Office products because of all different routes that they must use to access all their content. The Quick Access feature will allow users to access shared libraries from both their SharePoint and Teams locations. When the user opens files from shared libraries, these libraries will show up in the form of a list which will encourage users to save and open files to these libraries with ease. This helps deliver a more consistent, coherent storage location experience across M365 apps. This new backstage experience won’t show up in Teams, SharePoint, or OneDrive but does include storage locations from OneDrive and Teams (sites/channels) which are stored on SharePoint.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><b>When this will happen:</b></p><p>Targeted Release: We will begin rolling out late January 2024 (previously late October) and expect to complete by late February 2024 (previously late November).\n</p><p>Standard Release: We will begin rolling out mid-March 2024 (previously late December) and expect to complete by mid-April 2024 (previously late January).\n</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b><br></p>\n\n<p>This feature will make it easier for employees to get access to more of their storage locations, including Microsoft Teams where they may store more of the content for their projects.</p><p><img src=\"https://img-prod-cms-rt-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/cms/api/am/imageFileData/RE56A3F?ver=4e3f\" style=\"width: 400px;\"><br></p>\n<p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b></p>\n<p>There is no action needed to prepare for this change.

It only takes one click to update to new Teams. You can easily pick up and resume exactly where you left off in classic Teams and your chat messages, Teams and channels, and apps will appear in new Teams. \n</p><p><b>How will this affect your organization?</b></p><ul><li>From February 2024, an informational banner will appear for users on classic Teams to remind them about the timeline for auto-update and encourage them to update to new Teams.  \n</li><li>After March 31, 2024, any existing values for <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/new-teams-deploy-using-policies?tabs=teams-admin-center\" target=\"_blank\">new Teams client policies</a> will no longer be valid, and users who are still on classic Teams will be updated to new Teams automatically. \n</li><li>Users will not be able to switch back to classic Teams after March 31, 2024, because classic Teams will not be functional. Microsoft will attempt to uninstall classic Teams at this time. Visit <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/MicrosoftTeams/teams-classic-client-end-of-availability\" target=\"_blank\">this page</a> to learn more about the experience and different users impacted.\n</li><li>As mentioned in our previous <a href=\"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-teams-blog/announcing-general-availability-of-the-new-microsoft-teams-app/ba-p/3934603\" target=\"_blank\">new Teams GA announcement</a>, new features and capabilities as well as enhancements to existing features are available exclusively in new Teams. Hence, you should make this update a priority to keep your users up to date with new features and enhancements to existing features.\n</li></ul><p><b>Note:</b> New Teams is a performance-focused update. New Teams is <a href=\"https://research.gigaom.com/report/new-microsoft-teams-performance-benchmark\" target=\"_blank\">up to 2x faster and use 50% less memory</a>. There is no major impact to the user experience for new Teams. This means you don’t need to invest in any additional training.\n</p><p>We encourage you to review the <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/teams-client-update#servicing-agreement\" target=\"_blank\">service agreement</a> that governs Teams app updates.

If you would like Microsoft to manage the updates for your users, you can set the value to ‘Microsoft Controlled’.\n</li></ul><p>Notes: \n</p><ul><li>After June 30, 2024, classic Teams will no longer be available to use for the virtual desktop infrastructure (VDI) users, and they will need to update to new Teams to continue using Teams and avoid disruption.\n</li><li>The auto-update timeline of March 31, 2024, will not impact Microsoft Teams Rooms (MTR) and Surface Hub devices.\n</li><li>As communicated in our MC698876, Teams Live Event (TLE) producer support will be arriving in new Teams soon, at the beginning of March. We are committed to providing this support to avoid any disruptions to TLE producers because of the auto-update after March 31, 2024.\n</li></ul><p>To learn more about this announcement, view <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/MicrosoftTeams/teams-classic-client-end-of-availability\" target=\"_blank\">this page</a>.

We recommend that you:\n</p><ul><li>begin using Stream (on SharePoint)\n</li><li>direct your users to upload videos to SharePoint, Teams, OneDrive, and Yammer\n</li><li>put a plan in place for migration.\n</li></ul><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b>\n</p><p>Migrating your content from Stream (Classic):\n</p><p>All your existing Stream (Classic) videos can be transferred to Stream (on SharePoint) to take advantage of Stream’s rich integration within Microsoft 365. To support your move to Stream (on SharePoint) we have created migration tool that allows you to transfer your videos to SharePoint while also bringing over metadata, links and permissions associated with your videos.\n</p><p>To begin using the migration tool please refer to our 3-part Migration guide here: <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/stream/streamnew/stream-migration-guide-part1\" target=\"_blank\"> Guide to migrate data from Stream (Classic) to Stream (on SharePoint) - Part 1</a></p><p><b>How this affects your organization:</b>\n</p><p>Stream (on SharePoint) brings your users many of the capabilities of Stream (Classic) while allowing them to record and play videos directly in many everyday work and school apps such as Teams, Office.com, Yammer, Viva, PowerPoint, and SharePoint. In addition, Stream (on SharePoint) also enables you and your users to:\n</p><ul><li>Easily manage video files with the same security, admin controls, multi-geo support, compliance (eDiscovery, legal hold, retention, and data loss prevention policies), permissions, and sharing controls as the rest of your files in SharePoint and OneDrive. \n</li><li>Record videos with advanced tools directly in the camera like background blur or replace, inking, text, audio only, and teleprompter. \n</li><li>Search for videos anywhere in Microsoft 365. You can now find videos and Teams meeting recordings across Microsoft 365 by searching keywords.\n</li><li>Find what you need quickly on the Stream start page in Office. The new start page shows recent, shared, and favorite videos, with playlists coming soon. (Note: The Stream start page doesn't show you videos in Stream (Classic).) \n</li><li>View Teams Meeting Recordings with transcripts, chapters, timeline markers, speaker attribution, and comments. \n</li><li>Create custom page, site, and portal experiences to feature videos as part of your intranet and Viva Connections. \n</li><li>Share videos the same way you would any other file in Microsoft 365 with support for Guests, People in your Organization links, or unauthenticated external sharing with “anyone” links. \n</li><li>Get analytics per video, for all the videos in a site, or see who has watched your video. \n</li><li>Add videos to the Viva Connections Feed. \n</li><li>Use APIs based on the Microsoft Graph Files API for basic video file operations. \n</li></ul><p>These benefits add up to ease of video management for admins and more productivity for your teams.</p><p><b>Learn more:</b></p><p>Below are links to more information about migration and Stream (on SharePoint):\n</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://aka.ms/StreamMigration\" target=\"_blank\">Stream retirement and timeline</a> overview and migration tool details.\n</li><li>Settings to <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/stream/streamnew/migration-settings#save-videos-to-stream-on-sharepoint\" target=\"_blank\">delay Stream (Classic) disablement</a>\n</li><li>IT admin <a href=\"https://aka.ms/NewStream\" target=\"_blank\">overview of Stream (on SharePoint)</a></li><li>Stream (on SharePoint) <a href=\"https://aka.ms/StreamAdoption\" target=\"_blank\">adoption</a> and <a href=\"https://aka.ms/StreamUserGuide\" target=\"_blank\">end user guides.</a>\n</li><li><a href=\"https://aka.ms/StreamClassicToSPFeatureList\" target=\"_blank\">Stream (Classic) to Stream (on SharePoint) comparison</a>\n</li></ul>",

New Teams is <a href=\"https://research.gigaom.com/report/new-microsoft-teams-performance-benchmark\" target=\"_blank\">up to 2x faster and use 50% less memory</a>. There is no major impact to the user experience for new Teams.

Thank you for your patience.</p><p>We are currently working to improve user experience by providing a coherent profile photo experience across Microsoft 365. This primarily impacts those users of SharePoint online (SPO) who neither have an exchange license nor are using Delve for uploading images. This may also impact a small number of SPO admin who upload the user profile image on behalf of the end users.</p><p><b>When this will happen:</b></p><p>We will begin rolling out this change in early October 2023 (previously mid-September) and expect to complete by late March 2024.</p><p><b>How this affects your organization:</b></p><p>Currently, for users who do not have an Exchange License and have uploaded multiple different images across different apps in Microsoft 365, it is likely that SPO displays images uploaded locally in SPO which will be different from User Profile images in other Microsoft 365 apps.\n</p><p>To ensure that the same image is available across all Microsoft 365 experiences, going forward, SPO will display images sourced via MS Graph endpoint from Microsoft People System (MPS). This implies that the image uploaded via other apps in Microsoft 365 will take precedence and get displayed in SPO instead of the locally available image in SharePoint. There is no action required from users at this point.\n</p><p>For users with Exchange licenses there is no functional change.</p><p>To ensure profile coherence, we will disable local uploads from SPO to mysite host and instead enable centralized uploads to Microsoft People System (MPS).<br></p><p><b>What you can do to prepare:</b></p><p>For all users identified above: The profile image will no longer be edited/uploaded through SPO “Edit Profile UI” experience or through “Person Immersive” UI experiences. Instead, all such users would be requested to use the “Universal Me” control available on top right corner of the SharePoint Home page for uploading images. Alternatively, they can also use Delve to upload profile images.\n</p><p>For SPO admins: Admins who upload the user profile image on behalf of the end users will no longer be able to upload images via SPO Admin Centre. Instead, all SPO admins will be requested to upload user profile images via MAC Admin Centre or AAD admin center.\n</p><p>We are providing an early heads-up to ensure our customers have sufficient time to adapt to upcoming changes as we will not be able to grant any extension for this change.</p><p>\n</p>",

Teams live events allows you to create, host and produce live events with the same functionality that you get with Stream.

      "Content": "<p>Yammer is committed to strengthening the alignment of Yammer to Microsoft 365. This means we will no longer support tenants having more than one non-external Yammer network. This change will ensure Yammer networks have the same organizational boundaries as their corresponding Microsoft 365 tenants.\n</p><p><i>Why is this happening now?\n</i></p><p>Integrating Yammer more fully into the Microsoft 365 ecosystem has been a multi-year effort. New 1:many configurations have not been permitted since October 2018. All new Yammer networks provisioned after January 2020 have been created in Native Mode. In September 2022, <a href=\"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/yammer-blog/non-native-and-hybrid-yammer-networks-are-being-upgraded/ba-p/3612915\" target=\"_blank\">the enforcement of Native Mode was announced</a>. Automated network consolidation is an important prerequisite to reaching Native Mode and gaining access to broader safety, security, and compliance features. \n</p><p><b>When this will happen:</b>\n</p><p>Starting on May 1, 2023 and continuing through May 1, 2024. You are welcome to initiate network consolidation on your own at any time before or after May 1, 2023.\n</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b>\n</p><p>With automated network consolidation, you will lose access to all your secondary Yammer networks. Users from your secondary Yammer networks will be migrated to your primary network, but <b><i><u>groups and data will be lost.</u></i></b> In advance of this change, we strongly recommend that customers perform a full data export of their networks. You can read more about exporting data from your network <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/yammer/manage-security-and-compliance/export-yammer-enterprise-data\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.\n</p><p>It is strongly advised that customers <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/yammer/configure-your-yammer-network/faq-consolidate-multiple-yammer-networks\" target=\"_blank\">perform this network consolidation themselves</a>.  This will allow you to choose the time of the consolidation and allow the administrator to choose which primary domain will be associated with the remaining network.\n</p><p>There are Microsoft partners that can help you migrate data from your secondary networks. Please reach out to your Microsoft Account Team or <a href=\"https://products.office.com/yammer/partners\" target=\"_blank\">contact a partner</a> for more information.\n</p><p>Post-consolidation of the networks into 1:1 alignment with Microsoft 365, they will be upgraded to Native Mode. This provides access to the latest features in Yammer and ensures that Yammer and Viva Engage content is included in Microsoft Purview's compliance and security features.\n</p><p>You can read more about our plans to ensure alignment to Native Mode <a href=\"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/yammer-blog/non-native-and-hybrid-yammer-networks-are-being-upgraded/ba-p/3612915\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.\n</p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b>\n</p><p><i>If you would like to self-initiate your network consolidation:\n</i></p><ul><li>There is a guide to network consolidation available to walk you through the process. A network administrator can run the network migration tool from within Yammer.\n</li></ul><p><i>If you would like Microsoft to initiate your network consolidation:\n</i></p><ul><li>You are not required to take any action. Microsoft will notify you via the M365 Message Center of your scheduled consolidation date and default primary network and domain. The network with the highest total message count will be the default primary network. \n</li><li>If you would like a different default primary network, contact Microsoft 365 support to log an exception.\n</li></ul><p><i>If you need to postpone or schedule network consolidation around blackout dates:\n</i></p><ul><li>Contact Microsoft 365 support to log an exception.  \n</li></ul>",

      "Content": "<p>In 2018, <a href=\"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/exchange-team-blog/upcoming-changes-to-exchange-web-services-ews-api-for-office-365/ba-p/608055\" target=\"_blank\">we announced</a> that we were no longer making feature updates to Exchange Web Services (EWS) in Exchange Online, and we advised developers to move to Microsoft Graph.\n</p><p>Today, we are announcing that on October 1, 2026, we will start blocking EWS requests from non-Microsoft apps to Exchange Online.\n</p><p><b>When this will happen:</b></p><p>October 1, 2026</p><p><b>How this affects your organization:</b></p><p>While the EWS components of the service will continue to receive security updates and certain non-security updates, product design and features will remain unchanged. This change also applies to the EWS SDKs for Java and .NET, as well.\n</p><p>Despite this announcement, EWS is still available and supported for use in production environments. But we strongly suggest migrating to Microsoft Graph to access Exchange Online data and gain access to the latest features and functionality.\n</p><p>Today’s announcement and the retirement of EWS apply only to Microsoft 365 and Exchange Online (all environments); there are no changes to EWS in Exchange Server. Further, the changes in Exchange Online do not affect Outlook for Windows or Mac, Teams, or any other Microsoft product.\n</p><p>Migrating Applications to Microsoft Graph\n</p><p>We know there are several feature gaps between EWS and Microsoft Graph, and though the list below is not exhaustive, these are the gaps most frequently reported to us by developers:\n</p><ul><li>Access to Archive Mailboxes – We are working on delivering access to archive mailboxes via Microsoft Graph and will provide an updated timeline in the coming months.\n</li><li>Folder Associated Information / User Configuration – We are working on these features and will provide an updated timeline in the coming months.\n</li><li>Exchange Online Management – We are investigating solutions for this and will provide an updated timeline in the coming months.\n</li><li>Access to Public Folders – We are reviewing the need to provide third-party app access to Exchange Online public folders via the Graph API and are interested in hearing from customers and partners who build solutions that use public folders, other than backup and restore solutions. If you are willing to share details on how you use EWS with public folders, we’d love to hear from you, and you can reach us at <a href=\"mailto:EWSandPFfeedback@microsoft.com\" target=\"_blank\">EWSandPFfeedback@microsoft.com</a>.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>We know there are other gaps not listed above, and we continue to work on closing them, but it’s possible some functionality will not make it to Microsoft Graph. We encourage you to provide feedback to us, keep a close eye on the <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/graph/whats-new-overview\" target=\"_blank\">What’s new in Microsoft Graph</a> page, and explore alternatives for functionality or features not available in Microsoft Graph.\n</p><p>Next Steps\n</p><p>The retirement of these APIs follows our <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/lifecycle/policies/modern\" target=\"_blank\">Modern Lifecycle Policy</a>. We understand changes like this may cause some inconvenience, but we are confident it will ensure more secure, reliable, and performant experiences.\n</p><p>We will publish regular communications as we progress towards this deadline to aid affected tenants in identifying EWS usage. We encourage all customers to monitor Message Center and this blog for related content.\n</p><p>Thank you in advance for updating and opening your apps to a wider range of useful and intelligent features on Microsoft Graph. We are extremely excited about the growing opportunities that Microsoft Graph offers to developers, and we remain fully committed to our journey to empower developers to access Microsoft 365 data with the most modern features and tools.</p>",

We are making this change because basic authentication is a legacy authentication method that sends a username and password with each request. As a result, an attacker can access these credentials and use them to access resources. Continued use of Basic Authentication is a big security concern, so we have decided to deprecate it from all tenants.</p><p>\n</p><p>We will retire this feature in Office Apps version 2307+. Instead, we recommend moving to a more secure authentication method, preferably Modern Authentication, and enabling multi-factor authentication based on OAuth2.0 token-based auth.<br></p><p>This retirement will not affect Exchange Online and Exchange on-premises. Customers using basic authentication to connect to Exchange on-premises/Exchange Online can continue to use basic authentication without any changes to Exchange.<br></p><p>There is a separate effort to retire Outlook connecting to Exchange Online using Basic Authentication.

However, files stored on SharePoint Online, OneDrive for Business are not affected. Customers who currently store files on web servers that use Basic authentication can move those files to SharePoint Online, OneDrive for Business, or SharePoint Server on-premises as a solution.\n</p><p><b>Note:</b> This change is only impactful for organizations with on premises servers. If you do not have on premises servers, you can safely disregard this message.\n</p><p><b>When this will happen:</b><br></p><p>We will begin rolling this change to Current Channel in August 2023.</p><p>For additional channel timing please review: <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/deployoffice/security/basic-authentication-prompts-blocked#versions-of-microsoft-365-apps-affected-by-this-change\" target=\"_blank\">Basic authentication sign-in prompts are blocked by default in Microsoft 365 Apps</a></p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b></p><p>Once Basic authentication is disabled in your tenant, users with the Office Version 2307 or higher on their devices will not be able to access resources from servers using Basic authentication.<br></p><p>After the upgrade, end-users will get a Blocking message.

There will be no loss of functionality with the use of the Adobe Acrobat PDF engine and these capabilities will continue to be free of cost.

Users will also gain higher fidelity for more accurate colors and graphics, improved performance, strong security for PDF handling, and greater accessibility – including better text selection and read-aloud narration. Users will see an unobtrusive Adobe brand mark in the bottom corner of their PDF view. These users will also see an option to try the advanced features, such as converting PDFs, combining files, editing text and images. Users can sign in with their existing Adobe Acrobat subscription or can select the option to purchase an Adobe Acrobat subscription and download the Adobe Acrobat extension to use those features in Microsoft Edge. \n</p><p style=\"\"><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b></p><p style=\"\">To prepare, we recommend selecting users to test the addition of the Adobe Acrobat PDF engine into Microsoft Edge on the stable release in March 2023.

Thank you for your patience.</p><p>The Stream migration tool, which has been in preview since August of 2022, has now entered general availability. The tool is designed to help IT admins migrate video content from Stream (Classic) to Stream (on SharePoint). Admins can access the tool by logging on to the Stream Admin Center and then navigating to <i>Stream Migration &gt; Migration tool</i>.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></p><p>As announced in January, <a href=\"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-stream-blog/update-on-stream-classic-retirement-last-day-of-service-set-for/ba-p/3712075\" target=\"_blank\">Stream (Classic) will be retired on Feb 15, 2024</a> for all customers, except GCC customers. The successor service Stream (on SharePoint) is currently available for all customers. A critical step to begin adopting Stream (on SharePoint) is to migrate video content to it. The Stream migration tool has been designed to help admins move content from Stream (Classic) to Stream (on SharePoint) as there is no auto-migration within Stream (Classic).&nbsp;</p><p>\n</p><p>This message is associated with Microsoft 365 Roadmap ID <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?filters=&amp;searchterms=93361\" target=\"_blank\">93361</a></p><p><b>Note</b>: This message center post does not apply to Government Commercial Cloud (GCC) customers. The migration tool is not yet available for GCC customers, and we have not yet set a retirement date for the GCC instance of Stream (Classic). Until those dates are announced, GCC customers can continue to use Stream (Classic) without interruption. When these dates are announced GCC customers will receive both access to the migration tool and one-year advance notice of retirement.<i>&nbsp;</i></p><p><b>When this will happen:</b> \n</p><p> \n</p><p>GA: We will begin rolling out on February 15,2023 and expect to complete rollout by late February.</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b> \n</p><p>\n</p><p>As part of the Stream (Classic) retirement process we are introducing two default date settings which admins can adjust using the Stream (Classic) admin center.&nbsp;</p><p>How to delay the change that will block users from uploading to Stream (Classic):</p><ul><li>Beginning May 15, 2023 users will be blocked from uploading content to Stream (Classic) unless you take action to delay this change. You can delay this change to as late as August 15, 2023, after which videos will start saving to Stream (on SharePoint) by default. You can access the setting by navigating to the <i>Stream (Classic) Admin center &gt; Stream Migration &gt; Settings</i>. Under “<i>Save videos to Stream (on SharePoint)</i>” change the “<i>Scheduled for</i>” to your desired date.
