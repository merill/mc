This feature will be available for Public Preview in all Power Platform environments hosted in the United States region starting <b>November 18, 2025</b>.<br><br> This AI-powered capability is designed to improve the reliability of desktop automations by intelligently identifying and proposing the correct UI element when an automation action fails to find the expected one.<br><br>\nLeveraging advanced language models, the system analyzes screenshots and desktop context to suggest alternative elements, allowing automations to recover from certain errors automatically. This reduces manual intervention and helps keep flows running smoothly. <br><br>\nThe feature is available as an optional fallback in the error handling settings of individual actions and is intended to be used in scenarios where robust flow continuity is critical.<br><br>\n<b>How does this affect me?</b><br>\nMakers can opt-in to use this feature in the specific UI and browser automation actions where they want to retry with AI vision (in the event of an error occurring in their desktop flows during runtime). This setting is disabled by default in those actions and is accessed through the error handling screen of UI and browser automation actions in desktop flows.<br><br>\n<b>What action do I need to take?</b><br>\nThis message is for awareness, and no action is required.<br><br>\nPlease contact Microsoft Support if you need further assistance.",

This change is part of Microsoft’s ongoing security improvements and will affect how Outlook add-ins identify and process inline images using the attachment ID. Specifically, the update transitions from using tokenized image URLs to a more secure method using content IDs and request headers.</p>\n\n<p><b><b>When this will happen:</b></b></p>\n<p>This change will begin rolling out on November 15, 2025, to Production users.

As a result, your current parsing logic won’t be able to correlate the inline image in the mail body with the attachment ID or Base64 value of the image.</p>\n\n\n<p><b>What will happen:</b></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Images will be represented by a content ID (cid) in the src attribute.&nbsp;</li>\n<li>Add-ins that extract the attachment ID from the image URL will no longer be able to correlate images reliably.</li>\n<li>With this change, add-ins must:\n  <ul>\n\n<li>Parse the HTML message body and retrieve the <code>cid</code> value from the <code>src</code> attribute of the <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> element.</li>\n    <li>Use <code>Office.context.mailbox.item.getAttachmentsAsync</code> to retrieve an <code>AttachmentDetailsCompose</code> object.</li><li>To restore correlation, match the <code>contentId</code> property from the object to the <code>cid</code> value in the HTML.</li><li>To retrieve base64 value of the image attachment, use <code>office.context.mailbox.item.getAttachmentContentAsync</code>.&nbsp;</li>\n  </ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><b>Example AttachmentDetailsCompose object:</b></p>\n<pre><code>[\n{\n  \"id\": \"AAkALgAAAAAAHYQDEapmEc2byACqAC/EWg0AW4xUByFbp0CroCNphMYEEAADMWhyywAAARIAEADghOrwhp8zR7umVQRBkN51\",\n  \"name\": \"image.png\",\n  \"contentType\": \"image/png\",\n  \"size\": 2371,\n  \"attachmentType\": \"file\",\n  \"isInline\": true,\n  \"contentId\": \"7957e11a-ce80-438b-87cd-611b3d6a3ec4\"\n}\n]\n</code></pre>\n<p><b><b>What you can do to prepare:</b></b></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Update your add-in’s parsing logic to retrieve the <code>cid</code> value from the <code>src</code> attribute of inline images.</li>\n<li>Use <code>getAttachmentsAsync</code> to match the content ID with the image.</li>\n<li>Ensure your add-in supports both the previous and updated implementations during the rollout.</li>\n<li>Test your add-in to confirm it correctly identifies and processes inline images using the new method.</li><li>Update internal developer documentation if it references the previous method of parsing inline image URLs.</li><li>Communicate this change to helpdesk or support teams if they assist with Outlook add-in troubleshooting.</li>\n<li>Review the sample code provided in the <a href=\"https://devblogs.microsoft.com/microsoft365dev/changes-to-inline-images-in-outlook/\" target=\"_blank\">Microsoft 365 Developer Blog: Changes to inline images in Outlook</a>.</li><li>Leave a comment on this post or in <a href=\"https://devblogs.microsoft.com/microsoft365dev/changes-to-inline-images-in-outlook/\" target=\"_blank\">Microsoft 365 Developer Blog: Changes to inline images in Outlook</a>&nbsp;if you have any questions.</li>\n<li>Watch the <a href=\"https://youtu.be/z-vYEb4N2go\" target=\"_blank\">October 2025 Office Add-ins Community Call </a>(YouTube link)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><b><b>Compliance considerations:</b></b></p><p>Placing the content ID in the src attribute matches how classic Outlook on Windows represents inline images.</p>\n<table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n<tbody><tr><th>Compliance Area</th><th>Explanation</th></tr>\n<tr><td>Does the change alter how existing customer data is processed, stored, or accessed?</td><td>Inline image retrieval now uses secure headers instead of tokenized URLs, changing how image data is accessed.</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Does the change modify how users can access, export, delete, or correct their personal data within Microsoft 365 services?</td><td>The method for accessing inline image data in emails is updated, which may affect how add-ins handle personal data.</td></tr>\n</tbody></table><p></p>",

      "Content": "<p>Updated October 13, 2025: We have updated the content. Thank you for your patience.&nbsp;</p><p><b>When this will happen:&nbsp;</b>Updated Rollout Schedule for iPhone and iPad</p><p>The first phase of this change is in-product notifications in the M365 Copilot app to encourage users who are editing documents to install the Word, PowerPoint, Excel apps. Users who try to browse files or manage their OneDrive libraries will be promoted to install the OneDrive app. This in-app notification will roll out to TestFlight users at the end of August and become generally available the week of September 15, 2025. This is a modification from the initial post to allow our enterprise customers more time to prepare.</p><p>The second phase of this change updates the Word, PowerPoint and Excel functionality in the Microsoft 365 Copilot app with previewers that will be made available to TestFlight users only in October and GA rollout will begin mid-October 2025. This will be a gradual, phased rollout that will take about 4 weeks or so to reach 100% of customers. These changes only apply to iPhone for now, iPad will see similar changes with a start of TestFlight in early November, and the start of the GA rollout in mid November. For iPad we will have a phased rollout that gradually ramps up to 100% of GA in about 4 weeks time.</p><p>To get early builds and test out features before GA dates – you will need to join the iOS TestFlight program for the Microsoft 365 Copilot app.  There are a limited number of seats available in the iOS TestFlight program. We periodically remove inactive users (those who have not updated their build) to make space for others. If you are unable to join because the program is full, please check back later, or contact your Microsoft Support representative.

Users will continue to be able to view files and use Copilot Chat to get deeper analysis and insights on their content. If a user needs to edit, the M365 Copilot app will transition to the standalone Word, Excel, or PowerPoint apps. Users of the M365 Copilot app will continue to be able to browse and search recent files in the app, but users seeking comprehensive file management features will be encouraged to utilize the OneDrive app. When users land in the M365 Copilot app Search experience and navigate to the My files, Libraries, or My device entry points a notification will appear promoting the use of the OneDrive app for these actions.\n</p><p>Detailed Change Log: Word, Excel, PowerPoint, M365 Copilot App \n</p><ul><li>Word, Excel, PowerPoint: The Microsoft 365 Copilot app for iPhone and iPad will a provide a Copilot powered preview experience for documents. Users can view content and use Copilot Chat for file queries. Users who wish to edit the file will be prompted to open or install the standalone apps.\n</li><li>M365 Copilot App: The M365 Copilot app has evolved to an AI-first productivity assistant that brings together productivity activity across Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook and other Microsoft 365 apps. It gives your users the power of file previews and M365 Copilot chat in an experience that inherits all the security, identity and privacy policies you’ve set up in Microsoft 365.</li><li>Teams, OneDrive, Outlook iOS app integration: These apps on iPhone and iPad will continue to show users a preview of their Word, Excel and PowerPoint files. If users want to open and edit a Word, Excel, or PowerPoint file, they will now be directed to the respective standalone Word, Excel or PowerPoint app. The M365 Copilot app will no longer handle file open and edit operations from Teams, OneDrive or Outlook.</li><li> File Management: Searching for files within the M365 Copilot app will remain available. For advanced file management, users will be directed to the standalone OneDrive app. \n</li><li>Create Experience: Document creation in the M365 Copilot app will be available from chat. After file creation, users can view the file within M365 Copilot. Editing the document will transition to the standalone WXP apps. \n</li><li>Offline File Experience: For users who wish to make files available offline, please use the Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and OneDrive apps. \"Make Available Offline\" is being removed from the M365 Copilot app in favor of Copilot powered previewer experiences.\n</li><li>PDF Workflows: No changes. PDF handling continues as before in the M365 Copilot app.</li></ul><p><b>What you can do to prepare:&nbsp;</b>Updated Recommendations</p><p>•\tInform iOS and iPadOS users about the updated file experiences in the M365 Copilot app, and for users who have the need to edit WXP files on their mobile devices, encourage installation of the standalone Word, Excel, and PowerPoint apps.\n</p><p>•\tThe M365 Copilot app should continue to be available to end users as an AI-first productivity assistant.

Thank you for your patience.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p><a href=\"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-teams-blog/what-s-new-in-microsoft-teams-rooms-and-devices-at-enterprise/ba-p/3770137\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"font-family: sans-serif; font-weight: 400; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\">Earlier this year, the new Microsoft device ecosystem platform built on the Android Open-Source Project (AOSP) was announced</a> delivering state-of-the art security, reliability, and manageability with Microsoft Intune. Microsoft Teams Android devices will be migrating to this platform. The first step in the migration is a firmware update to Microsoft Teams Android devices in 2024. The firmware update will move devices from Android device administrator to Android AOSP management.</p><p><b>When this will happen:</b></p><p>A Preview program for select Microsoft Teams Android devices is targeted for Q2 of calendar year 2024. General release of the firmware update with the Android AOSP management stack will happen starting in Q4 of calendar year 2024 throughout Q1 of calendar year 2025 for all eligible Microsoft Teams Android devices. Auto updates will commence starting May 15th into Q3 calendar year 2025.</p><p>Eligible Microsoft Teams Android devices will initially receive a manual firmware update in Teams Admin Center so IT admins can manually verify the migration on their own schedule on select devices of their choosing.</p><p>Eventually, the firmware update for migration will be scheduled as an automatic firmware update in Teams Admin Center. This automatic firmware update can be deferred for up to 60 days from first availability based upon the admin configured stages in Teams Admin Center.</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b></p><p>The firmware upgrade, including the support for Intune management of Android (AOSP) devices must be accepted. It can be deferred for up to 60 days after it is first available. This can be done in the same way as other firmware upgrades in Teams Admin Center.&nbsp;</p><p>Devices will continue to remain signed in after the firmware upgrade.\n</p><p>Certain legacy devices will not receive the firmware upgrade for Android (AOSP) management in Intune. These devices will continue using Device Administrator.\n</p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b>\n</p><p>Policies will not be migrated automatically between Android device administrator and Android (AOSP) platforms. IT admins will need to create the appropriate new policies under the Intune Android (AOSP) platform to support their Microsoft Teams Android Devices. \n</p><p>This will need to be done before taking the firmware update for a successful migration. \n</p><p>More details on enabling support and creating enrollment profiles and policies for Intune AOSP can be found here: <a href=\"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/microsoftteamssupport/moving-teams-android-devices-to-aosp-device-management/4140893\" target=\"_blank\">Moving Teams Android Devices to AOSP Device Management | Microsoft Community Hub</a></p>\n\n \n<table><tbody>\n\n<tr><th>OEM</th>\n<th>Device Type</th>\n<th>Models</th>\n<th>Targeted Release</th>\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n<td>AudioCodes</td>\n<td>Phones</td>\n<td>C470HD</td>\n<td>Available</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr><td>AudioCodes&nbsp;</td><td>Phones</td>\n<td>C430HD\n<br>C435HD\n<br>C455HD<br></td>\n<td>Available</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr><td>AudioCodes&nbsp;</td>\n<td>Rooms</td>\n<td>RXV81<br>RXV200<br>RXPad<br></td>\n<td>Available</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n<td>Audiocodes</td>\n<td>Panels</td>\n<td>RX Panel</td>\n<td>Available</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n<td>Creston</td>\n<td>Panels</td>\n<td>TSS-770<br>TSS-1070<br></td>\n<td>April 2025</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n<td>Creston</td>\n<td>Rooms</td>\n<td>Crestron AIO Video Bar 70 \n<br>Crestron Touch Panel TS-1070<br></td>\n<td>March 2025</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n<td>Cisco</td>\n<td>Rooms</td>\n<td>Cisco Room Bar\n<br>Cisco Room Bar Pro \n<br>Cisco Room Kit EQ \n<br>Cisco Room Kit Pro\n<br>Cisco Desk Pro\n<br>Cisco Room Kit EQX \n<br>Cisco Board Pro G2 75\n<br>Cisco Board Pro 55\n<br>Cisco Board Pro 75\n<br>Cisco Board Pro G2 55 \n<br>Cisco Navigator<br></td>\n<td>Available</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n<td>Cisco</td>\n<td>Panels</td>\n<td>Cisco Navigator Panel</td>\n<td>Available</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n<td>DTEN</td>\n<td>Rooms</td>\n<td>DTEN D7X 75\"\n<br>DTEN D7X 55\" \n<br>DTEN Bar\n<br>DTEN Mate TC<br></td>\n<td>Available</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n<td>Jabra</td>\n<td>Rooms</td>\n<td>Jabra Panacast 50 VBS\n<br>Jabra Panacast 50 TC<br></td>\n<td>Available</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n<td>Logitech</td>\n<td>Rooms</td>\n<td>RallyBar <b>VR0019</b>\n<br>RallyBar mini <b>VR0020</b>\n<br>TAP IP <b>VR0029</b>\n<br>TAP\n<br>RoomMate <b>VR0030</b>\n<br>Logi Rallybar Huddle (VR0034]<br></td>\n<td>March 2025</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n<td>Logitech</td>\n<td>Panels</td>\n<td>Tap Scheduler  <b>VR0028</b>\n<br>DockFlex <b>VR0035</b><br></td>\n<td>March 2025</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n<td>Neat</td>\n<td>Rooms</td>\n<td>Neat Pad <b>NF19A1</b>\n<br>Neat Bar <b>NF19B1</b> \n<br>Neat Board <b>NF19C1</b>\n<br>Neat Bar Pro <b>NF21D1</b>\n<br>Neat Bar Gen2 <b>NF22E1</b>\n<br>Neat Board 50 <b>NF22H1</b>\n<br>Neat Board Pro 65  <b>NF23K1</b><br></td>\n<td>April 2025</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n<td>Neat</td>\n<td>Panels</td>\n<td>Neat Pad <b>NF19A1</b></td>\n<td>April 2025</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n<td>Neat</td>\n<td>Displays</td><td>Neat Frame <b>NF21F1</b></td>\n<td>TBD</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n<td>Poly</td>\n<td>Phones</td>\n<td>CCX350 \n<br>CCX400\n<br>CCX500\n<br>CCX505\n<br>CCX600\n<br>TrioC60<br></td>\n<td>March 25</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n<td>Poly</td>\n<td>Rooms</td>\n<td>Poly Studio X30\n<br>Poly Studio X50\n<br>Poly Studio X52\n<br>Poly Studio X70\n<br>Poly Studio X72\n<br>Poly Studio G7500\n<br>Poly Studio G62\n<br>Poly TC8\n<br>Poly TC10<br></td>\n<td>March 2025</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n<td>Poly</td>\n<td>Panels</td>\n<td>TC10 - Panel</td>\n<td>March 2025</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n<td>Yealink</td>\n<td>Phones  <b>MP5X</b></td>\n<td>MP54\n<br>MP56\n<br>MP58\n<br>CP965<br></td>\n<td>March 2025</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n<td>Yealink</td>\n<td>Phones  <b>MP5X E2</b></td>\n<td>MP52E2\n<br>MP54E2\n<br>MP56E2 \n<br>MP58E2<br></td>\n<td>March 2025</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n<td>Yealink</td>\n<td>Rooms</td>\n<td>Yealink MeetingBar A10\n<br>Yealink MeetingBar A20\n<br>Yealink MeetingBar A30\n<br>Yealink MeetingBar A40\n<br>Yealink MeetingBoard 65\"\n<br>Yealink MeetingBoard 86\"\n<br>Yealink Deskvision A24\n<br>Yealink CTP18 \n<br>Yealink CTP25<br></td>\n<td>Available</td>\n</tr>\n\n\n<tr>\n<td>Yealink</td>\n<td>Rooms</td>\n<td>Yealink MeetingBar A40</td>\n<td><br>March 2025</td>\n\n</tr><tr>\n<td>Yealink</td>\n<td>Panels</td>\n<td>Room Panel\n<br>RoomPanel Plus<br></td>\n<td><br>Available</td>\n\n</tr><tr>\n<td>Yealink</td>\n<td>Panels</td>\n<td>Room Panel E2\n<br>RoomPanel Plus E2<br></td>\n<td><br>April 2025</td>\n</tr>\n\n\n</tbody></table>",

Thank you for your patience.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>Microsoft Purview Insider Risk Management (IRM) will be adding a new role--Data Security Investigation Contributor--to the Insider Risk Management Investigators role group. This will allow members of the Insider Risk Management Investigators role group to launch   a Data Security Investigation (DSI) from an IRM case.</p><p>DSI is a new AI-powered solution that enables data security teams to identify incident-related data, conduct deep content analysis, and mitigate risk within one unified solution. DSI enables data security admins to efficiently identify incident-relevant content by searching their Microsoft 365 data estate to locate emails, Teams messages, Copilot prompts and responses, and documents. Once the investigation is scoped, DSI’s generative AI capabilities allow admins to gain deeper insights into the impacted data, revealing critical security risks and sensitive information. Investigative capabilities include the ability to categorize evidence, perform vector searches, and examine impacted data for security and sensitive data risks. DSI visualizes correlations between investigation data, users, and their activities. To mitigate identified risks, DSI facilitates secure collaboration between partner teams. Post-investigation learnings can be used to refine existing policies to strengthen an organization's security practices.  \n</p><p>The integration between IRM and DSI allows an IRM investigator to identify when a risky user needs deeper investigation to launch a pre-scoped investigation directly from the user activity pane, allowing them to view content analysis related to that user and better assess post-incident data impact.  \n</p><p>This message is associated with roadmap ID  <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?rtc=1%26filters%3D&amp;searchterms=485707\" target=\"_blank\">485707</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>\n</p><p><b>When this will happen:</b>\n</p><p>Public Preview (Worldwide): We will begin rolling out early April 2025 and expect to complete by late April 2025.</p><p>General Availability (Worldwide): We will begin rolling out in mid-October 2025 (previously mid-July) and expect to complete by mid-December 2025 (previously mid-August).</p><p> \n</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b> \n</p><p>With this update, members of the Insider Risk Management Investigators role group will be able to create Data Security Investigations from an Insider Risk Management case.

Review your current configuration to determine the impact for your organization. You may want to notify your admins about this change and update any relevant documentation.\n</p><p>Microsoft Purview Insider Risk Management correlates various signals to identify potential malicious or inadvertent insider risks, such as IP theft, data leakage and security violations. Insider Risk Management enables customers to create policies based on their own internal policies, governance and organizational requirements.

Thank you for your patience.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;We’re making some changes to DNS provisioning of A records for all new Accepted Domains provisioned after February 1st, 2025 (previously October 1st). Between early and late February 2026 (previously early October and late October), we will gradually switch provisioning of all A records for new Accepted Domains into the new subdomains under mx.microsoft.</p><p>We are doing this to reduce the friction of adopting DNSSEC in the long run. DNSSEC is a set of extensions to DNS that provides cryptographic verification of DNS records, preventing DNS spoofing and adversary-in-the-middle attacks to DNS.\n</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b>\n</p><p>After February 1st, 2025 (previously October 1st), all A records for new Accepted Domains will be provisioned into the new subdomains under mx.microsoft.February 1st, 2025 (previously October 1st) is not secured with DNSSEC at the domain level (ex. contoso.com), then DNS resolution will work as usual. If an Accepted Domain you add to the EAC after February 1st, 2025 (previously October 1st) is secured with DNSSEC, then DNSSEC will extend to the mx.microsoft DNS record automatically and you will get the benefits of DNSSEC without having to take any further action. Any issues with DNSSEC can be addressed by disabling DNSSEC for the Accepted Domain (ex. contoso.com) via your DNS provider.</p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b>\n</p><p>If you have any automation in place, for example in workflows for Domain Setup, for MX record creation that expects A records for newly provisioned Accepted Domains to be provisioned in mail.protection.outlook.com, this automation needs to be updated by February 1st, 2025 (previously October 1st) to use List serviceConfigurationRecords Graph API (<a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/graph/api/domain-list-serviceconfigurationrecords?view=graph-rest-1.0&amp;tabs=http\" target=\"_blank\">List serviceConfigurationRecords</a>). Use List serviceConfigurationRecords to retrieve the mailExchange value for your MX record. After February 1st, 2025 (previously October 1st), List serviceConfigurationRecords Graph API will be the only source of truth for your Accepted Domains’ MX record value. You will not be able to rely on the Accepted Domain’s A record being provisioned in mail.protection.outlook.com after February 1st, 2025 (previously October 1st).</p><p>If you are using automation that expects the record to end with mail.protection.outlook.com, when you add a new Accepted Domain to the Exchange Admin Center after February 1st, 2025 (previously October 1st), mail flow may not work upon initial configuration and you will have to update your MX record to match what the Exchange Admin Center says for the domain or use the mailExchange value returned by List serviceConfigurationRecords Graph API.\n</p><p>If you expect this change to cause any issues for your organization, please share that feedback. \n</p><p><br></p>",

Thank you for your patience.</p><p><b>Introduction\n</b></p><p>We’re introducing a <i>Unified Exclusion list </i>in <i>Copilot Analytics (Microsoft Viva Insights)</i>, a new feature that provides a single, consistent way to exclude specific users from all Viva Insights. With this update, administrators will have one consolidated exclusion list that applies across the Microsoft Copilot Dashboard (in Viva Insights), Manager and Team insights, Advanced Insights, and the upcoming Microsoft 365 Copilot Chat analytics (available in <i>Copilot Dashboard</i>). Admins can manage exclusions easily through one list, simplifying configuration and safeguarding sensitive user data without impacting other organizational HR data. This ensures consistent privacy controls and data reporting for both licensed and “free” (unlicensed) Copilot users in your organization.\n</p><p>Admins can use CSV upload and Azure Active Directory (Entra ID groups) to manage exclusions in the tenant.</p><p>This message is associated with Microsoft 365 Roadmap ID <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?filters=&amp;searchterms=500161\" target=\"_blank\">500161</a>.</p><p><b>When this will happen</b></p><p><b>General Availability (Worldwide): </b>We will begin rolling out this feature update globally, starting early October 2025 (previously late-September) and expect rollout to be completed by late October 2025 (previously early October).</p><p><b>How this affects your organization\n</b></p><p>All of Viva Insights experiences will now honor the excluded users (available in the Unified Exclusion list), eliminating the inconsistencies between different surfaces. For example, if an employee is on the <i>Unified Exclusion list</i>, that user’s data will be omitted from all Copilot Dashboards, manager insights, and analyst queries uniformly. This replaces the legacy approach where the Microsoft Copilot Dashboard had its own exclusion list and Advanced Insights relied on license or service plan removal.&nbsp;</p><p>The AI administrators, Viva Insights Administrators and Global Administrators will have access to configure this updated setting.\n</p><p>\n</p><p><b>Note: </b>Any users whom you previously excluded (via the old Microsoft Copilot Dashboard exclusion list) will automatically remain excluded under the new mechanism. Those users will continue to be fully excluded from all Viva Insights data, including the new M365 Copilot Chat usage analytics, without any additional action on your part. This ensures continuity of privacy controls for existing tenants.&nbsp;</p><p>Advanced insights will additionally, continue to exclude users for whom Viva insights service plan is not available.&nbsp;</p><p><b>What you can do to prepare\n</b></p><p>No immediate action is required to enable this feature.

These tenants will be transitioned to a unified management experience across both Microsoft 365 and Teams admin centers.</p><ul><li><b>For tenants with agent or app availability differences across both admin centers</b>, a <b>wizard</b> in the Teams admin center will help identify affected agents and apps and guide through resolving discrepancies.</li><li><b>For tenants with no agent or app availability differences across both admin centers, guidance </b>will be provided to help maintain unified availability policy for all future changes. </li></ul><p>This message is associated with Microsoft 365 Roadmap ID <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?filters=&amp;searchterms=503105\" target=\"_blank\">503105</a>.</p><p>3.\t<b>Phase 3 – Automatic Unification\n</b></p><p>Tenants that haven’t transitioned as part of Phase 1 &amp; Phase 2, will be automatically moved to unified app agent management. We will update this post with a timeline and more details later.</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization</b></p><p>Before this rollout, managing Teams apps that work in Outlook and the Microsoft 365 app was fragmented between the Integrated apps page in the Microsoft 365 admin center for Outlook and the Microsoft 365 app, and the Teams admin center for Teams. This sometimes resulted in different settings for the same app in the two admin centers. With Unified agent app management, you will be able to manage apps on the Integrated apps page in the Microsoft 365 admin center or in the Teams admin center, and any changes made in either admin center will synchronize.</p><div>What you can expect:\n</div><ul><li>You’ll gain a consolidated view of agent and Microsoft 365 app availability across both Microsoft 365 and Teams admin centers.\n</li><li>Changes made in either admin center to the agent and app availability will automatically apply across all supported hosts.\n</li><li>Organization-wide defaults for both admin centers will be in sync and govern app availability across Teams, Outlook, and the Microsoft 365 copilot app.</li></ul><p><b>&nbsp;What you need to do to prepare</b></p><p>To ensure a smooth transition, review your tenant-level and individual agent/app settings (app allow/block &amp; user availability) in both the Microsoft 365 Admin Center and the Teams Admin Center. If different departments within your organization manage these settings, we suggest coordinating efforts to complete the review collaboratively.\n</p><p>This update will be rolled out automatically by the stated date, and no immediate action is required. However, it's a good time to update any internal documentation related to agent and app management policies.&nbsp;</p><p>Learn more: <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/uam-tac-mac\" target=\"_blank\">Unified agent and app availability management across Microsoft 365 and Teams Admin Centers - Microsoft Teams | Microsoft Learn&nbsp;</a></p><p>\n</p>",

Devices that upgrade during a designated <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/deployment/windows-autopatch/manage/windows-autopatch-hotpatch-updates#release-cycles\" target=\"_blank\">baseline release period</a> (such as October) will remain eligible for hotpatching. Devices that upgrade during a non-baseline month (such as November) will temporarily stop receiving hotpatch updates and, until the next baseline release in January 2026, will instead receive standard security updates that require a restart.</p><p><b>When will this happen:</b></p><p>The Windows 11, version 25H2 upgrade will be offered starting September 30, 2025, with October 2025 designated as the baseline month for hotpatch eligibility. Organizations should plan their upgrade timing accordingly to maintain hotpatch continuity.</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b>\n</p><p>If you are using hotpatch-enabled quality updates in your tenant and a device upgrades to Windows 11, version 25H2 outside of a <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/deployment/windows-autopatch/manage/windows-autopatch-hotpatch-updates#release-cycles\" target=\"_blank\">baseline month</a>, it will temporarily receive standard (non-hotpatch) updates until the next baseline month.</p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b>\n</p><p>To ensure devices continue to receive hotpatch updates, please review the following:</p><ul><li>Review your feature update release schedule to ensure devices are positioned to update during baseline months. Look for the release date for your devices in your feature update policy as well as your feature update deferral settings in your Update Rings policies in Windows Autopatch.  \n</li><li>Review the hotpatch servicing cadence and upgrade timing implications.

Thank you for your patience.&nbsp;</p><p><b>Introduction</b></p><p>As part of the final phase of the Viva Engage rebranding, we’re updating the email sender domains used for Viva Engage communications. This change ensures a consistent and secure brand experience across all surfaces and completes the transition from Yammer to Viva Engage.</p><p>This update was previously communicated in MC679739, “Yammer Rebranding to Viva Engage Domain Migration Update,” in October 2023.</p><p><b>When this will happen</b></p><p></p><ul><li>The email sender domain rollout will begin in early September 2025 (previously late August) for U.S. and EU tenants currently receiving messages from @yammer.com and @eu.yammer.com respectively. The entire rollout is expected to complete by Q1 CY2026 (previously late October).\n</li></ul><p></p><ul><li>A fallback/coexistence period will be in place between September (previously August) and by Q1 CY2026 (previously late October). during which both the old and new domains will be supported. During this time, some users within a tenant may receive emails from the old domain while others receive them from the new domain.</li></ul><p></p><p><b>How this will affect your organization</b></p><p>The sender domain for Viva Engage emails will change as follows:\n</p><ul><li>From @yammer.com to @engage.mail.microsoft for U.S. and global regions.\n</li><li>From @eu.yammer.com to @eu.engage.mail.microsoft for European regions.\n</li></ul><p>These new domains are secured with industry-standard authentication protocols (e.g., SPF) to help prevent spoofing and ensure reliable delivery.\n</p><p>To enhance security and reduce cross-tenant spam, sender addresses will now include a tenant-specific prefix.

      "Content": "<p>Updated September 18, 2025: We have updated the timing and content below with additional information. Thank you for your patience.</p>\n<p>In response to customer feedback, we are introducing enhanced flexibility, greater scalability, and streamlined compliance management for private channels in Microsoft Teams.\n</p><p>Note: It is important for compliance managers to review and take appropriate action before migration starts for these changes to private channels. \n</p><p><b>What's changing?</b></p><p>Private channels will transition use a channel mailbox instead of individual user mailboxes. \n</p><p>Organizations with compliance policies (retention, legal hold, data loss prevention, or eDiscovery) for private channels must review these policies and must apply policies to the Microsoft 365 group for the channel’s team before migration begins to ensure continuity of the policy for a private channel.  Existing policies will continue to apply to user mailboxes; post-migration, new data will be governed by policies on the group. Note that policies applied to the team’s group can apply to all channels in the team.\n</p><p>After the transition to updated private channels in your organization, private channels will be updated as follows.\n</p><ol><li>Private channels are no longer limited to 30 per team. Instead, private channels can be added up to the limit of 1000 total channels per team.\n</li><li>Private channels can now have up to 5000 members, instead of 250.\n</li><li>Meetings can now be scheduled in private channels.\n</li><li>Compliance policies for private channels are part of the team’s group policies instead of the individual user level.\n</li></ol><p>The migration of private channels to the updated capabilities will begin in early October 2025 and continue through December 2025. During this period, private channels will continue to operate normally. Admins and compliance managers should complete any required policy changes by September 20, 2025, before the migration begins. Migration can start or end at different times for each tenant during the rollout period. To track progress, a new PowerShell command will be available for tenants to check whether their migration has started or is completed. This post will be updated soon with details on the PowerShell command.\n</p><p><b>When this will happen:</b>\n</p><p>General Availability (Worldwide): We will begin rolling out early October 2025 (prevously late September) and expect to complete by mid-December 2025.\n</p><p><b>Action required by compliance managers and admins</b></p><ol><li>Purview eDiscovery and Legal Hold</li>\n<p></p><p>With this change, private channel data will move from user mailboxes to the group mailbox, aligning with how shared channels data is stored. Previously, legal holds were applied to user mailboxes since private channel data resided in each member’s mailbox. Post-migration, the latest version of private channel message data from each user’s mailbox is moved to the private channel’s group mailbox. Message edits and deleted messages will not be copied into the group mailbox.\n</p><p>Note: For users on hold, copies of message edits and deleted messages will remain in the user’s preserved library folder until the hold expires, while the latest version of private channel message data from each user’s mailbox is copied to the private channel’s group mailbox. \n</p><p>Before migration\n</p><p>If a legal hold exists for a private channel, admins must also apply the policy to the team’s group, in addition to the policy already applied to users’ mailboxes, in order for a hold to apply to new data generated and stored in the private channel’s mailbox. Note that policies applied to the team’s group can apply to all channels in the team.\n</p><p><img src=\"https://cxcs.microsoft.net/file/ccp/en-us/752d2d97-48d7-4491-a3e7-ecc866373a44  \" width=\"400\" height=\"\"></p><p>Screenshot 1: Setting up a new hold in Microsoft Purview compliance portal.\n</p><p>After migration\n</p><p>For existing holds admins will need to ensure that the hold is applied to the user mailbox as well as the new group mailbox, in order for a hold to apply to existing and new message data. Any new legal holds will need to be applied to the group.\n</p><p>For complete eDiscovery, include both the private channel’s users’ mailboxes and the team’s group mailbox to retrieve pre-migration messages, message history, and post-migration new content.\n</p><p><img src=\"https://cxcs.microsoft.net/file/ccp/en-us/0de1f667-c352-400b-8a94-57237676a30d  \" width=\"400\" height=\"\"></p><p>Screenshot 2: Configuring an eDiscovery search in Microsoft Purview compliance portal.\n</p><li>Purview Data Loss Prevention (DLP)</li> \n<p></p><p>With this change, private channel messages will be included as a part of the DLP policy scoped to the private channel’s team’s group, as opposed to the user mailbox. \n</p><p>Before migration\n</p><p>Admins must modify the “Teams chat and channel messages” policy for private channels to add the team’s group containing the private channel, in addition to the user mailbox, in order to include new private channel messages in a policy.

Editing of existing policies will not be supported but policies can be removed.\n</p><p>Before migration\n</p><p>Apply current private channel retention policies (previously on user mailboxes) to Teams channel messages to include the team’s group, in order to include new private channel messages in a policy.

Rollout for scheduled meetings and channel Meet Now will be started in early July 2025 and expected to be completed by mid-July 2025. </p><p>General Availability (GCC High, DoD):&nbsp; We will begin rolling out early August 2025 (previously early June) and expect to complete by late October 2025 (previously mid-August).</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b>\n</p><p>The new URL syntax is: https://teams.microsoft.com/meet/&lt;meeting_id&gt;?p=&lt;HashedPasscode&gt; \n</p><p>To make meeting URL shorter, we are removing several parameters such as tenant ID, conversation ID etc. This change serves two main goals: 1) improving usability of URL during sharing and 2) making the URL more secure and less susceptible to malicious attacks. \n</p><p>Here are some details about how meeting links work and when they expire: \n</p><ol><li>In case the meeting organizer gets removed from the tenant, the links to the meetings scheduled by them automatically expire. \n</li><li>&nbsp;Every meeting link expires in 60 days after the scheduled event or in 8 hours, if it was created as Meet Now. Learn more about expiration timelines for different types of meetings. \n</li></ol><p>With the Short Meeting URL release, expiration limit will be applied to all newly created links. \n</p><p>Once the change to Short Meeting URL is released, all newly created meetings will expire as described in the documentation: 60 days after meeting ends for scheduled meetings and 8 hours after creation for Meet Now. Once this expiry period is over, in case someone clicks the link (e.g. outside of Teams app OR in the meeting details inside Teams calendar section), they will be unable to join the meeting.</p><p>Note: Old links created before short meeting URL release will continue working as it previously was (user will be able to join even after the documented expiry limits).</p><p>The reason why we are making this change is simple: security is our topmost priority. Maintaining a high security level is essential to protect sensitive data, prevent financial losses, ensure business continuity, and meet compliance and legal obligations. It is a critical aspect of modern digital life and business operations. This adjustment is designed to enhance the security of Teams meeting links, thereby better safeguarding the customer tenant. We want to be on par with modern security standards, that’s why the new behavior is a step in the right direction that we must take. It’s not possible to keep the current behavior. If you think it breaks some of your business processes, please leave comment to the MC post and describe your case there. \n</p><p>Recommendations in case the meeting link has expired:  \n</p><p>For meeting organizer: We recommend scheduling a new meeting. If the meeting organizer got removed from the tenant someone else should reschedule their meetings from scratch. \n</p><p>For participant: Please reach out to the meeting organizer and ask them to reschedule the meeting or send you an updated link.</p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b>\n</p><p>You may want to check if you have any integrations that use parameters from URL. After the rollout, the URL will only contain the meeting ID. Parameters such as tenant ID, organizer ID, conversation ID and message ID will not be in the URL. \n</p><p>You may inform meeting organizers from your tenant who use expired meeting links, or you may want to make a tenant-wide announcement about this change. \n</p><p>This rollout will happen automatically by the specified date with no admin action required. You may want to notify your users about this change and update any relevant documentation as appropriate.</p>",

Thank you for your patience.</p><p>Coming soon: A new integration between Insider Risk Management (IRM) and Data Security Investigation (DSI) in Microsoft Purview. This enhancement allows data security admins to launch a pre-scoped DSI directly from an IRM case, enabling deeper investigation into risky user behavior and better post-incident impact assessment.</p><p>DSI is a new AI-powered solution that enables data security teams to identify incident-related data, conduct deep content analysis, and mitigate risk within one unified solution. DSI enables data security admins to efficiently identify incident-relevant content by searching their Microsoft 365 data estate to locate emails, Teams messages, Copilot prompts and responses, and documents. Once the investigation is scoped, DSI’s generative AI capabilities allow admins to gain deeper insights into the impacted data, revealing critical security risks and sensitive information.

This improvement supports better alignment with modern security practices and over time will make it easier for organizations using multiple Microsoft products to manage and maintain their firewall configurations.

If your outbound traffic policy doesn’t include the new Azure Front Door IP address ranges, users may face login issues, devices might lose connectivity with Intune, and access to apps like the Intune Company Portal or those protected by app protection policies could be disrupted.</p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b>\n</p><p>Ensure that your firewall rules are updated and added to your firewall’s allowlist with the additional IP addresses documented under Azure Front Door by <b>December 2, 2025</b>.&nbsp;</p><p>Alternatively, you may add the service tag “AzureFrontDoor.MicrosoftSecurity” to your firewall rules to allow outbound traffic on port 443 for the addresses in the tag.&nbsp;</p><p>If you are not the IT admin who can make this change, notify your networking team.

Thank you for your patience.</p><p><b>Introduction</b></p><p>We hear your feedback about ways we can improve the notifications experience in Viva Engage. It's always a fine balance between ensuring your users are notified of relevant content without notifications feeling too overwhelming or noisy. In response to your feedback, we're rolling out an intelligent notifications experience. Specifically, this change will improve how <i>Community Announcement</i> notifications are delivered. This smarter delivery approach optimizes notifications delivery based on a user’s engagement behavior, helping to reduce notifications fatigue while ensuring timely visibility of announcements.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><b>When this will happen</b><b></b></p><p><b>General Availability (Worldwide): </b>We will begin rolling out this change in mid-September 2025 and expect to complete the rollout by early November 2025.</p>\n\n<p><b>How this affects your organization</b>\n</p><p>Previously, when an admin created a new Community Announcement, this would send a notification in Teams and Mobile Push immediately, followed by an email notification two hours later if the announcement was not opened already in Teams and/or Mobile Push.&nbsp;\nWith this new update:\n</p><ul>\n<li>Users will now receive the notification in <b>one channel only</b>—either Teams, Mobile Push, or Email. This notification channel may differ by user and is selected based on where a user has opened Engage notifications most frequently in the past 30 days.&nbsp;</li><li>If the announcement is not opened within two hours in the first notification channel, a <b>secondary notification channel</b> will be sent, also determined by where a user opens Engage notifications most frequently.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>We will continue to respect all user notification preferences and settings where applicable. If a notification channel is disabled or the app is not installed, it will not be selected as a potential notification channel for the Community Announcement delivery.</p><p>Note that this change applies only to<b> regular Community Announcements in Viva Engage</b> and does not affect the \"immediate\" Community Announcement feature (where admins can still select the checkbox to send emails immediately —this functionality remains unchanged).</p><p><b>Can I still notify Community users via email immediately (along with other notification channels)?&nbsp;</b></p><p>Yes! In Viva Engage, we offer an option to send an “immediate” Community Announcement. With this feature, Community admins can choose to send email notifications immediately after posting a Community Announcement, even if a user has opted out of receiving emails. All other notification channels will also send immediately along with email, including Teams and Mobile Push. Therefore, we recommend admins to use this feature when there is a Community Announcement that requires immediate attention from users.&nbsp;</p><p>Community Admins can find this “immediate” Community Announcement option by firstly navigating to the announcement publisher and selecting the hyperlinked <b><i>“option to send emails immediately” </i></b>at the bottom of the publisher. Upon clicking this option, an additional pop-up box will open called <i><b>“Immediate email delivery”</b></i>. By selecting this checkbox, this will ensure that all three notification channels – Email, Teams, and Mobile Push – will send to customers immediately after a Community Announcement is made.&nbsp;</p><p><b>\n&nbsp;What you can do to prepare</b>\n</p><p>No admin action is required. However, we recommend:\n</p><ul>\n<li>Informing your users about the new notifications change to reduce confusion</li>\n<li>Monitoring user feedback and engagement with <i>Community Announcements' notifications delivery</i></li>\n<li>Reviewing internal communication strategies to align with the new notification's behavior</li></ul><p></p><p></p>\n<table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n<tbody><tr><th>Compliance Area</th><th>Explanation</th></tr>\n<tr><td>Does the change alter how existing customer data is processed, stored, or accessed?</td><td>Yes.

If you disable or don’t configure this policy setting, users can use any location (Cloud, Local, and Network) to perform <i>Save As</i> and <i>Save new files</i>.

You can communicate this change to end users explaining the advantages of saving the files to the Cloud instead of saving to local folders: \n</p><ul><li>Easy collaboration: It’s easy to work with others—just share your Cloud file to start collaborating right away. You and your team can add comments and make changes together, and AutoSave keeps your work updated in real time. \n</li><li>Never lose your progress: Don’t worry about losing your work—files in the Cloud include AutoSave on, meaning your documents are automatically saved for you as you work.​ \n</li><li>Access from anywhere: Files you create in Word, Excel, or PowerPoint on Windows are instantly available from your Mac, web browser, iPhone, or Android device. When you make changes on one device, they are available from everywhere.  \n</li></ul><p>To minimize impact on users, we recommend moving (redirecting) known folders to OneDrive (<a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/sharepoint/redirect-known-folders\" target=\"_blank\">Redirect and move Windows known folders to OneDrive - SharePoint in Microsoft 365</a>) \n</p><p>To deploy this policy: \n</p><p>If you use  Active Directory, Microsoft Entra or hybrid environments,  you can use Group Policy Objects.

Please consider this tradeoff in your adoption strategy.</p><p>If your organization has governance tools for SharePoint Communication sites that work effectively in a reactive manner (i.e., governance is applied after the site is created), Microsoft recommends extending this process to include Loop workspaces rather than using this policy.</p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b>\n</p><p>There is nothing you need to do to prepare.

Thank you for your patience.</p><p><b>Introduction</b></p><p>We’re introducing Multi-Geo In-Region Routing (IRR) for Exchange Online, a new capability that helps organizations meet regional data residency requirements by allowing inbound email routing to be aligned with user locations. With IRR, admins can configure accepted domains to route messages directly to a designated geo-region, ensuring that email data is processed and stored entirely within the recipient’s region—even if it differs from the tenant’s primary location. This helps organizations meet compliance requirements without compromising email delivery performance.</p><p>This message is associated with Microsoft 365 Roadmap ID <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?filters=&amp;searchterms=410245\" target=\"_blank\">410245</a>.</p><p><b>When this will happen:</b></p><p>Public Preview: We will begin rolling out in early October 2025 and expect to complete by end of October 2025.\n</p><p>General Availability (Worldwide): We expect to begin rolling out in early December 2025 and expect to complete by late December 2025.</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b></p><p>In-Region Routing (IRR) is disabled by default. If you do not plan to use this feature, no action is required.</p><p>For domains where you choose to enable IRR, the feature allows you to route inbound emails to accepted domains associated with specific geo-regions. When these domains are aligned with users located in the same geo-region, emails are fully processed and stored within the recipient’s region. This ensures that data remains within the user’s Preferred Data Location (PDL), supporting stronger data sovereignty and compliance with regional regulations.</p><p>If your organization uses Microsoft Purview capabilities such as Data Loss Prevention (DLP), retention policies, or eDiscovery, you may need to review and adjust those policies to ensure they align with the new regional routing behavior.</p><p></p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b></p><ul><li>Ensure that admins have the necessary permissions to manage accepted domains and access to either Exchange Online PowerShell or to the Microsoft 365 admin center.</li><li>Review your domain configurations and identify users located in secondary geo-regions.\n</li><li>Prepare to configure accepted domains with the new geo-region property.</li><li>Review the licensing terms, as Multi-Geo licenses will be indefinitely required to use In-Region Routing:<ul><li><a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/enterprise/microsoft-365-multi-geo?view=o365-worldwide#licensing\" target=\"_blank\">https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/enterprise/microsoft-365-multi-geo?view=o365-worldwide#licensing</a></li><li><a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/enterprise/microsoft-365-multi-geo?view=o365-worldwide#getting-started\" target=\"_blank\">https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/enterprise/microsoft-365-multi-geo?view=o365-worldwide#getting-started</a>&nbsp;</li></ul></li><li>Review the documentation for configuring the feature: <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/enterprise/multi-geo-region-routing?view=o365-worldwide\" target=\"_blank\">Configure Multi-Geo In-Region Routing (In Preview) - Microsoft 365 Enterprise | Microsoft Learn\"</a></li></ul><p>We value your feedback and want to hear from you if you have any questions or concerns. Please comment or contact us through the M365 Admin Center if you need any assistance.</p><p><b>Compliance considerations:</b></p><ul><li>Does the change alter how existing user data is processed, stored, or accessed? - Yes. Emails are stored in-region based on domain configuration.</li><li>Does the change modify, interrupt, or disable any Purview capabilities? - Maybe. Depends on how DLP or retention policies are scoped by region.</li><li>Does the change alter how admins can monitor, report on, or demonstrate compliance activities? - Maybe. Regional routing may affect reporting granularity.</li></ul><p></p><p></p>",

Thank you for your patience.\n</p><p>Microsoft Fabric will introduce two Preview features called Workspace-level private links and <i>Outbound access protection </i>at the Fabric workspace level. At the tenant level, the corresponding settings <i>Configure workspace level inbound network rules</i> and <i>Configure workspace level outbound network rules</i> will be in the Advanced networking section of the Fabric admin portal.The new tenant-level settings will be disabled by default. You (the tenant admin) can switch ON the tenant toggle in the Fabric admin center if you decide to make this feature available to your workspace admins. This will allow the workspace admins to configure Workspace-level private links and Outbound access protection. The workspace admin will then decide whether to configure these features at the workspace level.&nbsp;</p><p><b>When this will happen:</b>\n</p><p>Public Preview (Worldwide): We will begin rolling out in late August 2025 (previously late July).</p><p>We will communicate the plan for General Availability in a future post.\n</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b>\n</p><p><i>Feature 1: Workspace-level private links</i>\n</p><ul><li>Private links provide secure inbound connectivity to Microsoft Fabric. Workspace admins can set up private links in Microsoft Azure to connect to a Fabric workspace from a specific virtual network.\n</li><li>In Fabric, workspace admins can choose to block inbound public access to your data to significantly reduce the risk of unauthorized access and potential data breaches. During Preview, admins can block inbound public access with the public REST API, which does not require a workspace-level private link set up in Azure. The corresponding-level tenant admin setting <i>Configure workspace level inbound network rules</i> will be available in the Fabric admin portal at <i>Tenant settings &gt; Advanced networking:</i>\n</li></ul><p></p><p><img src=\"https://cxcs.microsoft.net/file/ccp/en-us/3b49f2b6-47af-4042-895e-bbb33dca04ba\" style=\"width: 400px;\" alt=\"admin controls\">\n</p><p><i>Feature 2:</i> Outbound access protection<i> at the user workspace level</i></p><ul><li>Data exfiltration is a concern for many enterprises that store sensitive data in the cloud. When used with other networking features in Fabric, the <i>Outbound access protection</i> feature can help secure your data from exfiltration.  Workspace admins will be able to block all the outbound connectivity from the workspace. Once enabled, all outbound connections made by Fabric Spark artifacts from this workspace will be blocked. The only way to enable a connection is by first establishing a managed private endpoint (MPE) from the workspace to the destination.

Thank you for your patience.</p><p>As part of our ongoing efforts to enhance performance and scalability, Microsoft Defender for Office 365 investigation and hunting experiences are undergoing a data platform migration to establish a more robust, efficient, and scalable data storage system. This migration aims to improve data consistency and reliability, particularly in investigation and threat-hunting experiences.\n</p><p><b>When this will happen:</b>\n</p><p>General Availability (Worldwide, GCC, GCC High, DoD): We began rolling out this migration and Phase 1 of performance improvement early November 2024 and was completed in late June 2025.</p><p>The rollout of Phase 2 of performance improvement is targeted for end December 2025.</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b></p><p><i>Key benefits</i></p><ul><li><i>Ensures data consistency across multiple user experiences: </i>By consolidating data management under a unified platform, this migration will eliminate discrepancies between different workflows, ensuring that security analysts have access to consistent and reliable data across various investigation and hunting experiences.\n</li><li><i>Establishes data parity between Threat Explorer and Advanced Hunting: </i>By leveraging a single, unified data source, the migration will ensure that data retrieved in Threat Explorer and Advanced Hunting remains synchronized. This reduces the chances of data disparity between different tools and allows security teams to conduct investigations with better accuracy.\n</li><li><i>Enhances the data pipeline for Advanced Hunting, resulting in improved performance and accuracy</i>: The migration will optimize data ingestion pipeline and proactive monitoring system of Advanced Hunting. This will lead to improved data freshness and reduce the chances of potential data quality issues in data pipeline.\n</li><li><i>Accelerates development cycles for new features built on the new data platform: </i>The modernized data architecture will enable faster iteration and deployment of new features. By reducing dependencies on legacy systems and adopting a scalable infrastructure, Microsoft can introduce feature enhancements more rapidly, bringing greater value to security analysts.\n</li><li><i>Strengthens proactive monitoring capabilities to minimize potential impact on customer workflows:</i> The new platform will enhance real-time monitoring and alerting mechanisms, allowing for proactive detection and resolution of issues before they impact user workflows. Improved observability will ensure that any latency or disruptions are identified early, reducing downtime and improving system reliability.</li></ul><p><i>Potential impact</i></p><ul><li>No direct impact on customer data.\n</li><li>While the new platform brings significant improvements, users may experience slight delays in data availability (such as email metadata and post-delivery actions like quarantine release and manual remediation) in certain experiences, including Threat Explorer, Email Entity, and the Email Summary Panel.\n</li><li>In some cases, users may encounter intermittent failures for brief moment when loading the Email Summary Panel from experiences such as Quarantine and Submission immediately after an email is delivered. However, this will automatically resolve once the necessary data has been processed and stored.</li></ul><p><i>Resolution plan</i></p><p>While our team works on the migration, we are also actively working on optimizing the performance of the new data platform to align as closely as possible with the data freshness rate of Threat Explorer before the data platform migration. Also, efforts are underway to minimize failure rates across user experiences caused by temporary data unavailability.\n</p><p>The phase 1 performance improvement work was completed in late June 2025. After that, our teams are continuously monitoring the latencies and investing in further improvements to ensure seamless security operations experience to end users.</p><p>Phase 2 of the performance improvement plan is targeted to further improve the data freshness rate and is expected to complete by end of December 2025.</p><p>This change will be available by default.</p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b></p><p>This migration will happen automatically by the specified dates with no admin action required before the rollout.

Thank you for your patience.\n</p><p>Coming soon for Microsoft Purview: We are announcing the public preview of the integration of Adaptive protection with Data Lifecycle Management (DLM) to help you find the right balance to protect against data sabotage while enabling productivity. This new integration leverages DLM features to provide an additional control for Adaptive protection that automatically preserves items deleted by a user with an elevated risk level, so items can be restored if needed.</p><p>This message is associated with Microsoft 365 Roadmap ID <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?filters=&amp;searchterms=392839\" target=\"_blank\">392839</a>.\n</p><p><b>When this will happen:</b>\n</p><p>Public preview: We will begin rolling out in late June 2024 (previously early May) and expect to complete by late July 2024 (previously mid-July).\n</p><p>General Availability:&nbsp; We will begin rolling out early February 2026 and expect to complete by late February 2026.</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b>\n</p><p>After the rollout, and after you enable Adaptive protection for your tenant, the retention label and auto-apply policy for data lifecycle management will be automatically created for you. This policy will automatically include elevated risk users identified by Microsoft Purview | Insider Risk Management solution. If these users delete content from Microsoft SharePoint, Microsoft OneDrive, or Microsoft Exchange, a retention label is automatically applied to that content to retain it for 120 days. Retention labels are automatically applied to unlabeled content deleted by these users. When these users are no longer at the elevated risk level, they are automatically removed from the DLM policy, and the system will no longer keep a copy of content they delete. Any content copies previously retained when the user had an elevated risk level will be kept for the 120 days as specified by the retention label.\n</p><p>Unlike other retention labeling scenarios, users do not see the retention label, and you do not need to create or manage the retention label or policy. At this time, you can't change the retention period or assign different policies based on the different risk levels, or for different locations. The single retention label and auto-labeling policy for your tenant is not visible in the Microsoft Purview compliance portal.</p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b>\n</p><p>Learn more: <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/purview/retention#dynamically-mitigate-the-risk-of-accidental-or-malicious-deletes\" target=\"_blank\">Learn about retention policies &amp; labels to retain or delete | Microsoft Learn</a>\n</p><p>If you're using Adaptive protection and want to automatically retain content deleted by elevated risk users, follow these steps to turn on this new integration.\n</p><ol><li>Sign in to the <a href=\"https://compliance.microsoft.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Microsoft Purview compliance portal</a>.\n</li><li>Navigate to <i>Data lifecycle management &gt; Microsoft 365 &gt; Adaptive protection settings</i> in the top right corner.\n</li><li>Turn the setting ON and select <i>Save</i>.\n</li></ol><p>\n</p><p><img src=\"https://cxcs.microsoft.net/file/messagecenter/en-us/fe6a20ed-77ce-44ce-b862-bc7f4b78b93e\" style=\"width: 400px;\" alt=\"admin settings\">\n</p><p><img src=\"https://cxcs.microsoft.net/file/messagecenter/en-us/521b359c-13a9-41ef-ad96-215789a32eb3\" style=\"width: 400px;\" alt=\"admin settings\">\n</p><p>If you’re not using Adaptive protection already, turn on Adaptive protection and the new feature will be enabled along with Adaptive protection.\n</p><p>This rollout will happen automatically by the specified date with no admin action required before the rollout.

Thank you for your patience.</p><p>As part of the Microsoft Secure Future Initiative (SFI) and in alignment with the “Secure by Default” principle, we are updating default settings in Microsoft 365 to help you meet the minimum security benchmark and harden your tenant’s security posture. These changes target legacy authentication protocols and app access permissions that may expose organizations to unnecessary risk.\n</p><p>This is the first step in a broader effort to evaluate and evolve Microsoft 365 defaults through the lens of security best practices.\n</p><p><b>When this will happen:</b></p><p>These changes will begin rolling out in mid-July 2025 and are expected to complete by August 2025.\n</p><p><b>How this affects your organization</b></p><p>The following settings will be updated:</p><table class=\"table table-bordered\"><tbody><tr><td>Settings</td><td>Impact</td></tr><tr><td>Block legacy browser authentication to SharePoint and OneDrive using RPS (Relying Party Suite)</td><td>Legacy authentication protocols like RPS (Relying Party Suite) are vulnerable to brute-force and phishing attacks due to non-modern authentication. Blocking this prevents applications that are using outdated methods from accessing SharePoint and OneDrive via browser. To use PowerShell to block legacy browser authentication, see <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.online.sharepoint.powershell/set-spotenant?view=sharepoint-ps#-legacybrowserauthprotocolsenabled\" target=\"_blank\">Set-SPOTenant</a>.</td></tr><tr><td>Block FPRPC (FrontPage Remote Procedure Call) protocol for Office file opens</td><td>FrontPage Remote Procedure Call (FPRPC) is a legacy protocol used for remote web page authoring. While no longer widely used, Legacy protocols such as FPRPC can be more susceptible to compromise and blocking FPRPC helps reduce exposure to vulnerabilities. With this change, FPRPC will be blocked for opening files, preventing the use of this non-modern protocol in Microsoft 365 clients. To learn how to block the FPRPC protocol, see <a href=\"https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2324509\" target=\"_blank\">turn on web content filtering</a>.</td></tr><tr><td>Require admin consent for third-party apps accessing files and sites</td><td><p>Users allowing third-party apps to access file and site content can lead to overexposure of an organization’s content. Requiring admins to consent to this access can help reduce overexposure. With this change,  Microsoft managed <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/enterprise-apps/manage-app-consent-policies\" target=\"_blank\">App Consent Policies</a> will be enabled, and users will be unable to consent to third party applications accessing their files and sites by default. Instead, they can request administrators to consent on their behalf. To configure admin consent, follow instructions here: <a href=\"https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2324703\" target=\"_blank\">Configuring the Admin Consent workflow</a>. Customers who have already blocked user consent, turned on our previously recommended consent settings, or applied custom user consent settings will not be affected by this change.<br>Admins can also configure granular app access policies, such as limiting user access to the application for specific users or groups. Learn more <a href=\"https://aka.ms/entra-app-access\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.<br></p></td></tr></tbody></table><p>These changes are on by default and apply to all Microsoft 365 tenants. No additional licensing is required.\n</p><p><b>What you can do to prepare:</b></p><p>We recommend the following actions:\n</p><ul><li><b>Assess current configurations:</b> As applicable, identify current configurations for <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/sharepoint-online/set-spotenant?view=sharepoint-ps#-legacybrowserauthprotocolsenabled\" target=\"_blank\">RPS </a>or <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/module/sharepoint-online/set-spotenant?view=sharepoint-ps\" target=\"_blank\">FPRPC</a> protocols.</li><li><b>Notify stakeholders: </b>Inform IT admins, app owners, and security teams about the upcoming changes.\n</li><li><b>Update documentation: </b>Ensure internal guidance reflects the new defaults and admin consent process.\n</li><li><b>Configure Admin Consent workflow:</b> If third party apps access is applicable for your organization, learn how to set up the workflow: <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/enterprise-apps/configure-admin-consent-workflow\" target=\"_blank\">Configuring admin consent workflow.</a></li></ul><p>Additional considerations\n</p><ul><li>Does the change alter how existing customer data is processed, stored, or accessed?

No specific user action is required. Links to the previous domains are backwards compatible and continue to be supported.

This includes specifying which Sensitive Information Types (SITs) are classified and what activities are collected on Windows endpoint devices.\n</p><p>This message is associated with Microsoft 365 Roadmap ID <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?filters=&amp;searchterms=479760\" target=\"_blank\">479760</a>.\n</p><p><b>When this will happen:</b>\n</p><p>Public Preview: Available now.</p><p>General Availability (Worldwide): We will begin rolling out late June 2025 (previously early June) and expect to complete by mid-July 2025 (previously late June).\n</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b>\n</p><p><i>Key benefits of collection policies</i></p><ul><li>Granular control: Align with regulatory, regional, and organizational requirements that specify what types of data can be collected. \n</li><li>Noise reduction: Focus on the most relevant data security risks by tailoring data discovery and signals to what’s important for your organization \n</li></ul><p><i>Purview solutions impacted \n</i></p><ul><li>Unlike traditional Purview Data Loss Prevention (DLP) or Microsoft Purview Information Protection policies, collection policies are designed to streamline discovery of relevant information, rather than apply enforcement or take action on that information. There is no action taken from these policies to block content, as policies are meant to scope what content is collected and surfaces to administrators.</li><li>Using collection policies to scope signal collection will impact what is surfaced in several Purview solutions, including Insider Risk Management (IRM), Data Security Posture Management (DSPM), eDiscovery, Data Lifecycle Management (DLM), Activity Explorer, and more.

If you choose to leverage collection policies, admins can now choose which signals to discover in devices.\n</p><p>After you enable collection policies, you may see various updates to the Purview DLP audit experience. These updates may affect your organizations current configuration in the following ways: \n</p><ul><li>Activities to audit on your tenant will be scoped to the selected SITs and user activities \n</li><li>A new Location picker experience will be used to scope users and groups \n</li><li>To use collection policies for endpoints, the DLP <i>Always audit </i>setting will still need to be enabled. However, once created, collection policies for endpoint devices adjust from an open policy to an allowlisting policy that supports inclusion and/or exclusion of specific users, groups, and specified activities to reduce load and address customer requirements. \n</li></ul><p>This feature is available by default for admins to configure.</p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b>\n</p><p>There is no immediate impact of this feature release until you create an initial collection policy and <i>Always audit</i> is enabled in DLP (Windows endpoint devices only). To prepare for this upcoming enhancement to the Purview portal, we recommend you:</p><ul><li>Review Microsoft Learn docs on collection policies and required prerequisites: <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/purview/collection-policies-solution-overview\" target=\"_blank\">Collection Policies Solution Oerview (preview) | Microsoft Learn</a></li><li>Help inform other Purview admins whose signal collection would be scoped, including the solutions in this message. \n</li></ul><p>This rollout will happen automatically by the specified dates with no admin action required before the rollout.

To help protect sensitive content and support compliance with data handling policies, copying text from live captions is now disabled by default. This ensures captions remain a real-time experience, reducing the risk of content being copied and shared out of context.\n</p><p>Second, the <i>Live transcript</i> panel will no longer open automatically for the user who starts recording, which also triggers transcription in the background. Before this rollout, this panel only auto-opens for the person who initiates recording or transcription — not for other participants — but this can be distracting and isn’t always relevant to the user's intent. After this rollout, the <i>Live transcript</i> panel will remain closed unless manually opened or the user explicitly starts transcription. This gives users more control over their meeting layout and helps avoid unnecessary screen changes during important discussions.\n</p><p>Third, when transcription is enabled, users who attempt to open the<i> Live transcript</i> panel will now see a banner suggesting they switch to live captions instead.

Thank you for your patience.</p><p style=\"margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:7.5pt;margin-left:0in\"><b>Important update regarding the cloud hosted Mailbox External Recipient Rate Limit:</b>  In order to reduce the impact on customers, Microsoft has again decided to delay the rollout of the cloud hosted Mailbox External Recipient Rate Limit (MERRL) by ~six months. The MERRL will go into enforcement in April 2026 for trial tenants and new tenants if the tenant is provisioned on/after April 1st, 2026. In April 2026, the Exchange Admin Center Report will be available for tenant admins to review Sender mailbox data on external recipient volume. In October 2026, the MERRL will go into enforcement for all cloud hosted mailboxes in the WWMT environment including existing tenants.</p><p style=\"margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:7.5pt;margin-left:0in\">Please refer to the ACS email documentation (Prepare an email communication resource for Azure Communication Services - An Azure Communication Services concept article | Microsoft Learn) or reach out to your Microsoft account team for further support in this journey.</p><p style=\"margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:7.5pt;margin-left:0in\"><b>Please note:</b> We have made the decision to not proceed with this change for DoD, GCC, or GCC High organizations at this time. We will communicate via Message center when we are ready to proceed. The External Recipient Rate Limit will only apply to WWMT/Production.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:7.5pt;margin-left:0in\">Please refer to the ACS email documentation (Prepare an email communication resource for Azure Communication Services - An Azure Communication Services concept article | Microsoft Learn) or reach out to your Microsoft account team for further support in this journey.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:7.5pt;margin-left:0in\"> ________________________________________\n</p><p style=\"margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:7.5pt;margin-left:0in\"><br></p><p style=\"margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:7.5pt;margin-left:0in\">Today, we are announcing that, beginning in April 2026 (previously October 2025), Exchange Online will begin enforcing an external recipient rate limit of 2000 recipients in 24 hours.</p><p>Exchange Online does not support bulk or high-volume transactional email. We have not enforced limiting of bulk email until now, but we plan on doing so with the introduction of an External Recipient Rate (ERR) limit. The ERR limit is being introduced to help reduce unfair usage and abuse of Exchange Online resources. </p><p><b>When this will happen:</b></p><p>The new ERR limit will be introduced in 2 phases:</p><p>Phase 1 - Starting April 1, 2026, (previously October 2025) the limit will apply to cloud-hosted mailboxes of trial tenants and all tenants created after this date.&nbsp;</p><p>Phase 2 – Starting October 1, 2026, (previously April 2026) we will start applying the limit to cloud-hosted mailboxes of existing tenants.&nbsp;</p><p> <b>How this will affect your organization:</b></p><p>Exchange Online enforces a Recipient Rate limit of 10000 recipients for cloud-hosted mailboxes. The 2000 ERR limit will become a sublimit within this 10000 Recipient Rate limit. There is no change to the Recipient Rate limit, and both of these will be rolling limits for 24-hour windows. You can send to up to 2,000 external recipients in a 24-hour period, and if you max out the external recipient rate limit then you will still be able to send to up to 8,000 internal recipients in that same period. If you don't send to any external recipients in a 24-hour period, you can send to up to 10,000 internal recipients.</p><p>For example:\n</p><ul><li>You use a cloud-hosted mailbox to send to 1,000 external recipients and 2,000 internal recipients at 6:00AM on Day 1, for a total of 3,000 recipients. You then send to another 1,000 external recipients at 8:00AM on Day 1. Because you sent to 2,000 external recipients, you will be blocked from sending to external recipients until 6:00AM on Day 2. During this period, you are able to send to up to 6,000 internal recipients, but for this example, let's assume that you don't.\n</li><li>At 6:00AM on Day 2, the 1,000 external recipients and 2,000 internal recipients sent at 6:00AM on Day 1 will no longer count toward the 24-hour limit calculation. Thus, from 6:00-8:00AM on Day 2, you can send to up to 9,000 total recipients (e.g., 9,000 internal or 8,000 internal plus 1,000 external).\n</li><li>If you don't send to any internal or external recipients during this period, then at 8:00AM on Day 2 you can again send to 10,000 recipients total with up to 2,000 of them being external recipients.</li></ul><p>\n</p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b><br></p><p>If you have a cloud-hosted mailbox that needs to exceed the ERR limit, you can move to <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/communication-services/concepts/email/email-overview\" target=\"_blank\">Azure Communication Services for Email</a>, which is designed specifically for high volume email sent to recipients external to your tenant.</p>",

It is an advanced method of sending messages to your users and requires proper configuration of SPF, DKIM, and DMARC to ensure messages are delivered successfully.</p><p>Many customers do not need to use Direct Send. Because SPF protections do not always outright block messages and sometimes deliver them to the Junk folder, it is possible for malicious senders mimicking Direct Send to have their messages that spoof your own domains land in the Junk folder and potentially confuse your users. Before this rollout, no feature existed to block Direct Send traffic for customers who have no need to use it.

Direct Send traffic may include third-party services that you have given permission to use your domain or one of your own email applications hosted on-premises. To avoid having these messages rejected when this feature is enabled, they need to be authenticated. You can authenticate them by creating a <i>partner mail flow connector</i> for these messages.    \n</p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b>\n</p><p>This rollout has happened automatically by the specified dates with no admin action required before the rollout. Review your current configuration to assess the impact on your organization. You may want to notify your users about this change and update your relevant documentation.\n</p><p>By default, the new opt-in <code>RejectDirectSend</code> setting is set to <code>False</code>.  To enable the Reject Direct Send feature, Exchange Online admins can run this Microsoft PowerShell cmdlet: \n</p><p><code>Set-OrganizationConfig -RejectDirectSend $true</code>\n</p><p>The change should propagate out to your entire service within 30 minutes. With the feature enabled, any received Direct Send messages will see the following message:  \n</p><p><code>550 5.7.68 TenantInboundAttribution; Direct Send not allowed for this organization from unauthorized sources</code> \n</p><p>Unless you re-enable Direct Send, any messages that hit this error will need a partner connector created to authenticate their source as an approved sender.  \n</p><p>Learn more: <a href=\"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/exchange/introducing-more-control-over-direct-send-in-exchange-online/4408790\" target=\"_blank\">Introducing more control over Direct Send in Exchange Online | Microsoft Community Hub</a></p><p>We invite Exchange admins to try out the feature and provide feedback that we can use to validate and proceed to offering this feature for General Availability.</p>",

Expect no further delays beyond this date. Please review the information below for more details.\n</p><p>Updated October 18, 2024: We have updated the SMTP AUTH Clients Submission Report in the Exchange admin center, adding the Authentication Protocol column to show if Basic auth or OAuth is being used to submit email to Exchange Online. The data will build up over the next 90 days. Thank you for your patience.\n</p><p>Today, we are announcing that Exchange Online will permanently remove support for Basic authentication with Client Submission (SMTP AUTH) gradually beginning with a small percentage of submission rejections for all tenants on March 1st 2026 and reaching 100% rejections on April 30th 2026, (previously September 2025). After this time, applications and devices will no longer be able to use Basic auth as an authentication method and must use OAuth when using SMTP AUTH to send email.\n</p><p>Basic auth is a legacy authentication method that sends usernames and passwords in plain text over the network. This makes it vulnerable to credential theft, phishing, and brute force attacks. To improve the protection of our customers and their data, we are retiring Basic auth from Client Submission (SMTP AUTH) and encouraging customers to use modern authentication methods that are more secure.\n</p><p><b>When this will happen:</b>\n</p><p>We will be making this change beginning March 1st, 2026, and completing April 30th, 2026 (previously September 2025).\n</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b>\n</p><p>The SMTP AUTH Clients Submission Report in the Exchange admin center has been updated to show if Basic auth or OAuth is being used to submit email to Exchange Online. Starting in July 2025, we will send monthly Message Center posts to tenants who are using Basic auth with Client Submission (SMTP AUTH) to alert them to the upcoming change.\n</p><p>Starting March 1st 2026 (previously September 2025) we will gradually start rejecting Basic Auth requests to the Client Submission (SMTP AUTH) endpoints, increasing to 100% rejection by the end of the April 2026. \n</p><p>The Client Submission (SMTP AUTH) endpoints in scope for this change are:\n</p><p>•\tsmtp.office365.com\n</p><p>•\tsmtp-legacy.office365.com\n</p><p>Once Basic auth is permanently disabled, any clients or apps connecting using Basic auth with Client Submission (SMTP AUTH) will receive this response:\n</p><p>•\t550 5.7.30 Basic authentication is not supported for Client Submission.\n</p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b>\n</p><p>If your client supports OAuth, follow these steps: <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/exchange/client-developer/legacy-protocols/how-to-authenticate-an-imap-pop-smtp-application-by-using-oauth\" target=\"_blank\">Authenticate an IMAP, POP or SMTP connection using OAuth</a>\n</p><p>If your client doesn’t support OAuth and you must use Basic Auth with Client Submission (SMTP AUTH), you will need to switch to one of the following alternatives before April 2026, previously September 2025:\n</p><p>•\tIf you are using basic authentication with Client Submission (SMTP AUTH) to send emails to recipients internal to your tenant, you can use Microsoft 365 High Volume Email.

      "Content": "<p>Updated June 6, 2025: Enforcement actions on unlicensed OneDrive accounts are ongoing. Please continue to monitor your <a href=\"http://spo.ms/admin#/oneDriveAccounts/management\" target=\"_blank\">Unlicensed OneDrive Account report</a>, as all accounts listed will be subject to enforcement if no action is taken.  To support more informed decision-making, we’ve introduced new and more granular reasons for why an account may appear unlicensed but and has not been deleted. This added detail should help you take the appropriate actions for each case and will be available in your Unlicensed OneDrive Accounts report no later than June 24th.  In some cases, admin action is required to delete the accounts. The timeline for enforcement remains unchanged from our last update.</p><p>Enforcement began on January 27, 2025. The rollout has slowed to ensure a safe roll-out with sufficient time for admins to adjust. Admins should anticipate that it takes time for all unlicensed accounts to complete the enforcement process. The initial enforcement rollout will be complete by October 29, 2025.</p><p><b>Timeline for accounts unlicensed before July 28, 2025\n</b></p><ul><li>September 26, 2025: By this date, all unlicensed accounts transition to read-only mode. Admins are advised to check after this date. Checking earlier can result in an incomplete status snapshot.\n</li><li>October 29, 2025: By this date, all unlicensed accounts are archived. Admins are advised to check after this date. Checking earlier can result in an incomplete status snapshot.</li></ul><p><b>Timeline for accounts unlicensed after July 28, 2025</b></p><ul><li>For accounts unlicensed after July 28, 2025, the account will be put into read-only mode on the 60th unlicensed day, and will be archived or moved to the recycle bin on the 93rd unlicensed day.\n</li></ul><p><b>Example:\n</b></p><ul><li>Unlicensed Date: October 1, 2025\n</li><li>Day 60: Nov 30, 2025. The account is placed in read-only mode. </li><li>Day 93: January 2, 2026: The account is archived. If the user is still active in Entra ID but the admin hasn't enabled billing, then this is also the date on which the account will begin the deprovisioning process.</li><li>Admins are encouraged to monitor account statuses based on these timelines to ensure compliance and take any necessary actions.</li></ul><p><b>When will this happen:</b> \n</p><p>&nbsp;General Availability (Worldwide): We began rolling out late January 2025 and expect to complete by late October 2025 (previously late March).</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization</b>\n</p><p>After this storage policy goes into effect in your tenant, any OneDrive user accounts that have been unlicensed for more than 93 days will be archived automatically and will become inaccessible to end users. Admins can view these accounts with admin tools, but the accounts will not be accessible to users until admins take action on them. For example, a OneDrive account that became unlicensed on August 1, 2025 will be inaccessible to users as of October 1, 2025.</p><p>As an admin, you can view a list of unlicensed accounts in your tenant by navigating to SharePoint admin center &gt; <i>Reports &gt; OneDrive accounts</i>. Some admins will have access to this page as soon as July 26, 2024, but most admins will be able to access the page closer to August 16, 2024.\n</p><ul><li>Set up the Archive billing for unlicensed accounts to be able to access and edit the archived files.\n</li><li>Delete the unlicensed OneDrive account, if it does not have a retention policy applied to it. \n</li><li>Renew the unlicensed account to maintain access.\n</li></ul><p></p><p>The <i>Unlicensed OneDrive accounts</i> page that will be in Microsoft admin center:\n</p><p><img src=\"https://cxcs.microsoft.net/file/messagecenter/en-us/8f5c65a0-5515-49e1-b876-07e81c69a89a\" style=\"width: 400px;\" alt=\"admin controls\"> \n</p><p>After the unlicensed accounts are automatically archived, you can access the files in these accounts by enabling unlicensed account billing in the Microsoft 365 admin center. Once enabled, unlicensed account billing applies to all unlicensed OneDrive accounts in your tenant. There is a fee of $0.05/GB/month to store unlicensed accounts in the Microsoft 365 Archive, and a fee of $0.60/GB to reactivate accounts stored in the Microsoft 365 Archive. Account reactivation takes up to 24 hours and provides 30 days of access to the account, and then the account returns to an archived state.\n</p><p>If you take no action for OneDrive accounts that have been unlicensed for longer than 93 days, these accounts will remain inaccessible to end users until you set up an Azure subscription and enable unlicensed account billing in the Microsoft SharePoint admin center. This action will not affect tenants who have not changed the default tenant retention settings.\n</p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare</b>\n</p><p>To prepare for this change, admins can view a list of all the unlicensed OneDrive accounts in their tenant by going to the SharePoint admin center and navigating to <i>Reports &gt; OneDrive accounts</i> (this page will be rolled out to admins between July 26, 2024 and August 16, 2024). This page will provide the number of unlicensed accounts and why the accounts are unlicensed. You may have unlicensed accounts in your tenant for four reasons: \n</p><ol><li>Retention period – Account is no longer licensed but is still active because a retention period setting is keeping the account from being deleted.\n</li><li>Retention policy – Account is no longer licensed but is still active because a retention policy in Purview is keeping the account from being deleted. \n</li><li>Active user with no license – Account is active but is not licensed. This can happen if the license is removed but the user is not removed from Microsoft Entra ID (formerly Azure Active Directory).  \n</li><li>Duplicate accounts – Account is a duplicate because a licensed user has multiple OneDrive accounts associated with them. Duplicate accounts (also known as non-primary accounts) may arise if a user has geographic move, if a user leaves and then rejoins an organization, or from other factors. \n</li></ol><p>After you have taken inventory of your unlicensed accounts, we recommend that you take the following action before January 27, 2025. \n</p><ol><li>Delete unlicensed accounts that you no longer wish to retain. \n</li><li>Set up billing for accounts that you wish to retain.\n</li><li>You may want to notify your users about this change and update any relevant documentation.\n</li></ol><p>*<b>At this time, these changes do not apply to customers in Education tenants. An Education tenant is any tenant with more than 50% education licenses. Any tenant with fewer than 50% education licenses is considered commercial.&nbsp;</b>However, for any education tenant, unlicensed OneDrive accounts consume pooled storage and can pose security and compliance risks. IT admins can view the unlicensed accounts on the <i>OneDrive accounts</i> page to identify unlicensed accounts and take action.</p><p><i>Learn more</i>\n</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/SharePoint/unlicensed-onedrive-accounts\" target=\"_blank\">Manage unlicensed OneDrive user accounts - SharePoint in Microsoft 365 | Microsoft Learn</a>\n</li><li><a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/sharepoint/retention-and-deletion\" target=\"_blank\">OneDrive retention and deletion - SharePoint in Microsoft 365 | Microsoft Learn</a>\n</li><li><a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/admin/add-users/delete-a-user?view=o365-worldwide\" target=\"_blank\">Delete a user from your organization - Microsoft 365 admin | Microsoft Learn</a></li></ul><p></p>",

To address this, we’re enhancing our detection logic to go beyond just the visible file extension. After this rollout, even if a file’s extension is altered, Exchange will evaluate the actual content of the file to determine its true type.

We have made progress on closing several parity gaps with more changes in development to be released in the coming quarters. Please refer to <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/exchange/clients-and-mobile-in-exchange-online/deprecation-of-ews-exchange-online\" target=\"_blank\">Deprecation of Exchange Web Services in Exchange Online</a> for up-to-date guidance and roadmap information.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>If you haven't already, start the process of working with your application development organization and your application vendors to migrate active EWS applications on your tenant to the Graph API.&nbsp;</p><p>\n</p><p><b>When this will happen:</b></p><p>October 1, 2026</p><p><b>How this affects your organization:</b></p><p>While the EWS components of the service will continue to receive security updates and certain non-security updates, product design and features will remain unchanged. This change also applies to the EWS SDKs for Java and .NET, as well.\n</p><p>Despite this announcement, EWS is still available and supported for use in production environments. But we strongly suggest migrating to Microsoft Graph to access Exchange Online data and gain access to the latest features and functionality.\n</p><p>Today’s update and the retirement of EWS apply only to Microsoft 365 and Exchange Online (all environments); there are no changes to EWS in Exchange Server. Further, the changes in Exchange Online do not affect Outlook for Windows or Mac, Teams, or any other Microsoft product.</p><p>In our original blog post, we said this change would affect only third-party (non-Microsoft) applications.<b> We have expanded our effort and are now also removing EWS dependencies from Microsoft apps and services, and we’re going to complete that work well before October 2026</b>. We intend to do this as quickly as possible without affecting the quality of service or product.&nbsp;</p><p>There may be applications running on your tenant created by your organization or 3rd parties that use EWS. <b>We recommend <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/admin/activity-reports/ews-usage?view=o365-worldwide\" target=\"_blank\">reviewing your application portfolio</a> now </b>to get an understanding of which apps need to be updated by your organization and which applications require updates from vendors.</p><p>It is important to get started with this effort as soon as possible as the Graph API patterns are quite different from EWS. Equivalent Graph API operations may exhibit subtle differences that affect your use cases and application designs in unanticipated ways.</p><p>Migrating Applications to Microsoft Graph&nbsp;</p><p>We know there are several feature gaps between EWS and Microsoft Graph, and though the list below is not exhaustive, these are the gaps most frequently reported to us by developers:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Access to Archive Mailboxes – We are working on delivering access to archive mailboxes via Microsoft Graph and will provide an updated timeline in the coming months.\n</li><li>Folder Associated Information / User Configuration – We are working on these features and will provide an updated timeline in the coming months.\n</li><li>Exchange Online Management – We are investigating solutions for this and will provide an updated timeline in the coming months.</li><li>Access to Public Folders – After evaluating the usage of public folders, we have decided to restrict programmatic access to public folders to supported Outlook clients only, and for bulk import/export purposes. We will not provide APIs for programmatically creating, reading, updating and deleting public folders after October 2026 (also see <a href=\"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/exchange/security-related-updates-in-exchange-online/4303525\" target=\"_blank\">Security Related Updates in Exchange Online</a>).&nbsp;</li></ul><div><br></div><p>We know there are other gaps not listed above, and we continue to work on closing them, but it’s possible some functionality will not make it to Microsoft Graph. We encourage you to refer to <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/exchange/clients-and-mobile-in-exchange-online/deprecation-of-ews-exchange-online\" target=\"_blank\">Deprecation of Exchange Web Services in Exchange Online</a> for up-to-date guidance and roadmap information.&nbsp;</p><p><b>Next Steps\n</b></p><p>The retirement of these APIs follows our <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/lifecycle/policies/modern\" target=\"_blank\">Modern Lifecycle Policy</a>. We understand changes like this may cause some inconvenience, but we are confident it will ensure more secure, reliable, and performant experiences.\n</p><p>We will publish regular communications as we progress towards this deadline to aid affected tenants in identifying EWS usage. We encourage all customers to monitor Message Center and the Exchange Blog and <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/exchange/clients-and-mobile-in-exchange-online/deprecation-of-ews-exchange-online\" target=\"_blank\">Deprecation of Exchange Web Services in Exchange Online </a>for related content.&nbsp;</p><p>Thank you in advance for updating and opening your apps to a wider range of useful and intelligent features on Microsoft Graph. We are extremely excited about the growing opportunities that Microsoft Graph offers to developers, and we remain fully committed to our journey to empower developers to access Microsoft 365 data with the most modern features and tools.</p>",

      "Content": "<p>Coming soon: You will be able to extend Microsoft Purview to the network layer by integrating Purview with your preferred Secure Access Service Edge (SASE) / Security Service Edge (SSE) solution. Through this integration, admins can intercept and inspect traffic flowing through the network layer to identify the presence of sensitive data. This enables admins to detect sensitive data shared with untrusted cloud applications through browsers, applications, APIs, add-ins, and more, including common generative AI, cloud storage, and content sharing services. The signals from inline discovery for the network further enrich Purview solutions including Data Security Posture Management (DSPM) and Insider Risk Management (IRM), helping admins better understand how to reduce data exfiltration risks to locations outside of their organization.

The last day of its availability is on March 31, 2025. This change is being made as we streamline search experiences and focus on enhancing core productivity tools.\n</p><p>The Microsoft Edge for Business address bar and the Windows search box will continue to support work and school search, with some adjustments detailed below. \n</p><p>Details of the Change\n</p><p>After March 31, 2025, Microsoft Search in Bing will no longer be available, with changes as follows:\n</p><ul><li>Bing.com will no longer show work or school search results. Consequently, there will not be a dedicated page of work or school results and users’ work or school profiles will no longer appear on Bing.com. However, selecting the Work or School tab on Bing.com will redirect users to the new Microsoft Search experience on M365.cloud.microsoft (formerly Office.com and Microsoft365.com).\n</li><li>Search boxes you’ve configured to point to Microsoft Search in Bing will no longer provide work or school results.\n</li><li>The Edge for Business address bar and Windows search box will continue to support work and school search with some adjustments, including:\n<ul><li>The Edge for Business address bar will no longer return work or school search results on a Bing.com page but will continue to provide suggested results in the address bar. In addition, the address bar will send users to work and school results on M365.cloud.microsoft rather than Bing.com. Users of the address bar can continue to find work-related documents, bookmarks, and people in suggested results—clicking on these suggestions takes users to work or school results on M365.cloud.microsoft. Users can also type \"work\" in the address bar, hit the tab key, then input their work- or school-related query to get results on a M365.cloud.microsoft page. Work and school search results will include documents, people, and bookmarks. Work search for documents will be available initially, with additional content types available as quickly as possible.\n</li><li>The Windows search box will no longer display organization branding nor the “Work” or “School” tab but will continue to support work and school search. Search for documents and people remains available. will be available initially, with additional content types available as quickly as possible.

(For details on changes, please refer to the FAQ: https://aka.ms/MSBFAQ.)\n</p><p>Users who click on suggestions in the Edge for Business address bar or Windows search box may be redirected to Microsoft365.com before March 31, 2025. Also, as we begin testing the retirement experience, a small set of users may find before March 31 that Bing is intermittently unavailable as an entry point for work search. We recommend that you proactively inform your users of the change and direct them to M365.cloud.microsoft (formerly Office.com and Microsoft365.com) and SharePoint Online. Adding M365.cloud.microsoft to their favorites or to the favorites bar in Edge for Business may be a helpful alternative pathway. \n</p><p><b>What you can do to prepare:</b></p><p>Customers should prepare to stop using Microsoft Search in Bing by March 31, 2025, and transition to using Microsoft Search through M365.cloud.microsoft (formerly Office.com and Microsoft365.com) and SharePoint Online. We recommend that you inform users about the upcoming change and the alternatives available. \n</p><p>Adding your preferred entry point from this set to favorites or favorites bar in Edge may be a helpful alternative pathway. Admins can easily set favorites in Edge for their organization, please see details here. \n</p><p>Additionally, users can continue to use the Edge for Business address bar and the Windows search box, with some changes expected. Please educate users that they should now type \"work\" in the address bar, hit the tab key, then type in their work-related query to get work results on a M365.cloud.microsoft page.\n</p><p>If your organization is using the <code>AddressBarMicrosoftSearchInBingProviderEnabled</code> policy today, you should update to the <code>AddressBarWorkSearchResultsEnabled</code> policy, if the policy is still needed.   \n</p><p>The new policy, <code>AddressBarWorkSearchResultsEnabled</code>, will be available starting in early March, with Edge for Business version 134 (ahead of the Microsoft Search in Bing deprecation). This allows admins to configure the display of work suggestions in the address bar. If the policy is enabled or not configured, users who are signed into Edge for Business with their Entra ID can view internal work-related suggestions, such as bookmarks, files, and people results powered by Microsoft 365, in the Edge for Business address bar suggestion dropdown. If the policy is disabled, Entra ID signed-in users will not see internal workplace results in the Microsoft Edge address bar suggestion dropdown. \n</p><p>Admins who wish to set their own deprecation date prior to March 31, 2025, can turn off Microsoft Search in Bing by going to the Microsoft 365 admin center &gt; Settings &gt; Search &amp; Intelligence.\n</p><p>Regarding SafeSearch settings: \n</p><ul><li>If you had set the search experience for your organization to “School search,” SafeSearch was set to Strict by default. If you’d like to ensure that your users continue to have SafeSearch set to Strict after the Microsoft Search in Bing retirement, you can map www.bing.com to strict.bing.com at a network level.

The current behavior of the EWSEnabled flag is that it can be set at both the tenant (organization) level and the user (mailbox) level. Currently, when the flag is set to true at the user level, it takes precedence over the organization-level setting. If a setting is Null, it means the setting is not enforced at that level. If Org and user-level are both Null, the default behavior is to allow. This hierarchical structure means that if the organization-level flag is set to false, but the user-level flag is set to true, EWS requests from that user are still allowed. In summary:</p><table class=\"table table-bordered\"><tbody><tr><td>Organization Level</td><td>User Level&nbsp;</td><td>EWS Requests</td></tr><tr><td>True or &lt;null&gt;</td><td>True or &lt;null&gt;</td><td>Allowed</td></tr><tr><td>True or &lt;null&gt;</td><td>False</td><td>Not Allowed</td></tr><tr><td>False</td><td>True</td><td>Allowed</td></tr><tr><td>False</td><td>False or &lt;null&gt;</td><td>Not Allowed</td></tr></tbody></table><p>This approach has led to situations where it can be challenging for administrators to ensure uniform policy enforcement across their organization, particularly in large and complex environments.</p><p>New Behavior\n</p><p>To address these issues, we are altering the behavior so that EWS will only be allowed if both the organization-level and user-level EWSEnabled flags are true. Here's a simplified view of the new logic:</p><table class=\"table table-bordered\"><tbody><tr><td>Organization Level</td><td>&nbsp;User Level</td><td>EWS Requests</td></tr><tr><td>True or &lt;null&gt;</td><td>True or &lt;null&gt;</td><td>Allowed</td></tr><tr><td>True or &lt;null&gt;</td><td>False</td><td>Not Allowed</td></tr><tr><td>False</td><td>True or &lt;null&gt;</td><td>Not Allowed</td></tr><tr><td>False</td><td>False</td><td>Not Allowed</td></tr></tbody></table><p>In short, EWS will be permitted only if both the organization and user-level allow it. This change ensures that administrators have better control over EWS access and can enforce policies more consistently across their entire organization</p><p><b>Next Steps:</b>\n</p><p>Please check the blog for additional information and ensure your per-user and tenant wide settings are correct before this change is made to your tenant. \n</p><ul><li>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aka.ms/EWSEnabledChange\" target=\"_blank\">The way to control EWS usage in Exchange Online is changing</a>&nbsp;</li></ul><p><b><br></b></p>",

This change prioritizes active engagement, ensuring only registered users access conversation updates and reducing the volume of emails sent to non-registered users. External users who have activated their accounts will receive conversations and community emails.\n</p><p>We will begin rolling out this change early December 2024 and expected to complete by early January 2025.

After this date, the app will no longer receive support, and the app will become read only.\n</p><p>To ensure the best experience moving forward, we strongly recommend switching your users to the <a href=\"https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/xpffzhvgqwwlhb?ocid=pdpshare&amp;hl=en-us&amp;gl=US\" target=\"_blank\">Microsoft OneNote for Windows</a> app as soon as possible. Our team is focusing on enhancing this app, providing a sleek and modern interface and improving security, and releasing new features like Loop components, voice dictation and transcription, ink improvements, a new meeting details experience, integration with the new Microsoft Outlook, and more to align with the evolving needs of our users.\n</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b>\n</p><p>Although OneNote for Windows 10 is supported until October 14, 2025, it is no longer receiving new feature updates, and it does not benefit from improvements to data syncing.\n</p><p>Starting in January 2025, users will start to see notifications in OneNote for Windows 10 about the end of support. These notifications will provide additional information and direct users to resources for a smooth transition.\n</p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b>\n</p><p><i>1. Migration guidance</i>:\n</p><p>We have developed a detailed <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoft-365-apps/deploy/deployment-guide-onenote\" target=\"_blank\">Deployment guide for OneNote</a> that includes best practices of migrating and a sample migration script. This sample script is designed to simplify the migration process for IT admins and to ensure that your users' unsynchronized data is backed up during migration. We believe this migration guidance will significantly help in achieving a successful migration process.\n</p><p><i>2. OneNote migration support in October 2024:</i>\n</p><p>To ensure a smooth transition, we are offering additional support from the OneNote team to help with the migration process for tenants who want to migrate early. The team is only available in the month of October 2024. After that, you will need to rely on the deployment guidance. To engage the OneNote team in October 2024, please provide feedback as usual on this post and include your email address.\n</p><p><i>3.

We have concluded  through  customer feedback that this change to our initial deprecation plan, by maintaining support   for Live Events, will empower customers to produce large events as established and provide more time to upgrade to town hall, our new digital streaming event solution for large events, on their own schedule. Town hall will continue to serve as the platform where we will deliver new product value to our customers.</p><p>Teams Live Events will continue to be supported. We want to ensure that customers can upgrade to town hall on their own schedule as we work to bring new features and capabilities to town hall.  Town  hall is already available for commercial customers in public clouds, and we are adding new features regularly.</p><p>If you are using Teams Live Events for your large-scale digital events, you can continue to do so past the previously announced deprecation date of September 30th, 2024. However, we encourage you to try town hall, which offers a more modern and interactive experience for your live events.&nbsp;</p><p>You don't need to do anything at this time to continue using Teams Live Events.

This provides commercial customers with a 12-month window to prepare for the retirement and transition off Teams Live Events.&nbsp;</p><p><b>When this will happen:</b></p><p>September 30, 2024</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b></p><p>After September 30, 2024, Teams Live Events will no longer be supported, and access will be discontinued. Customers will not be able to schedule, start, or join any events on Teams Live Events after this date. Existing recordings will be available to access until December 31, 2024. If customers want to retain any recordings from prior events, they will need to download the recordings and upload them to a different location before December 31, 2024. Between now and September 2024, customers can continue to use Teams Live Events with no change in their existing experience. However, our recommendation is that customers (both existing and new) transition to and start to use town halls as it becomes generally available on October 5, 2023.</p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b></p><p>To prepare your organization for the transition we advise:\n</p><ul><li>Start to use town hall as it becomes generally available on October 5.</li><li>Learn more about town hall when documentation becomes available on adoption.microsoft.com and learn.microsoft.com on October 5.</li><li>Start planning to download recordings your organization wishes to retain before December 31, 2024.</li></ul><p><br></p>",

The first version of Microsoft 365 Apps for enterprise without Office Telemetry Dashboard will be Version 2208, which is expected to be available first in Current Channel in the second half of August 2022.  \n</p><p><b>Note:</b> If you do not use Office Telemetry Dashboard, you can disregard this message.  \n</p><p>Components of the Office Telemetry Dashboard will no longer be available in Version 2208 or later including the Office Telemetry Agent, Office Telemetry Processor, and the dashboard itself.  \n</p><p><b>Note:</b> Office Telemetry Log is not being removed and will still be available on client devices running Windows.</p><p><b>When will this happen:</b><br></p><p>The first version of Microsoft 365 Apps for enterprise without Office Telemetry Dashboard will be Version 2208. That version is expected to be available first in Current Channel in the second half of August 2022. \n</p><p>Version 2208 is expected to be available in Semi-Annual Enterprise Channel in January 2023. \n</p><p><b>Note:</b> Office Telemetry Dashboard is not being removed from existing perpetual versions of Office, such as Office Professional Plus 2019. If you are using a perpetual version of Office, Office Telemetry Dashboard will be supported as long as your version of Office is supported. Here are the end of support dates for perpetual versions of Office that include the Office Telemetry Dashboard: \n</p><ul><li>Microsoft Office 2013 – April 11, 2023 \n</li><li>Microsoft Office 2016 – October 14, 2025 \n</li><li>Microsoft Office 2019 – October 14, 2025 \n</li></ul><p> <b>How this will affect your organization:</b> </p><p>Once a device in your organization updates to Version 2208 or later of Microsoft 365 Apps, Office Telemetry Dashboard components will be either removed or become unsupported.</p><p>To access information about the COM and VSTO add-ins in your environment, you can use the inventory feature available in the Microsoft 365 Apps admin center \n</p><p> <b>What you need to do to prepare:</b></p><p>As the devices update to Version 2208 or later, the Office Telemetry Dashboard and Office Telemetry Agent will be automatically uninstalled from the devices.</p><p>However, the Office Telemetry Processor will need to be manually removed from devices using your standard management tools as there will be no new data for it to process. Similarly, the rest of the infrastructure including the shared folder and the SQL Server for permanent storage of telemetry data will become obsolete and therefore can be removed.  \n</p>",
