With this release, Planner adds enforcement for content‑level labels (block copy/print/export, read‑only, etc.) on plans and tasks consistent with Microsoft Purview policies and RMS usage rights.</p>\n\n<p><b>Question:</b> Which plan types are covered and when?<br>\n<b>Answer:</b> Rollout begins with Roster Plans followed by Group‑backed Plans.</p>\n\n<p><b>Question:</b> Do I need to change any Purview policies or configurations?<br>\n<b>Answer:</b> No changes are required for existing labels; however, you should review label protection settings (e.g., copy/print/export restrictions) and confirm RMS usage rights align with expected Planner behaviors. Update governance guidance accordingly.</p>\n\n<p><b>Question:</b> How does this interact with Loop and Teams meeting notes/TLC?<br>\n<b>Answer:</b> Loop meeting notes apply a single content label across the page and its components (including Task List components (TLC)). Planner now inherits and enforces those restrictions on the corresponding roster plan, preventing prior sync breaks when restrictive labels were applied.</p>\n\n<p><b>Question:</b> What happens to guest/external users under different label combinations?<br>\n<b>Answer:</b> Container labels determine who can be added; content labels determine what actions are permitted. For example, guests can be added when the container allows it, but content‑level restrictions may prevent plan access or actions (copy/export/print).</p>\n\n<p><b>Question:</b> Who can change a plan’s sensitivity label?<br>\n<b>Answer:</b> Typically, owners/editors with the appropriate rights can change labels. Permissions are enforced service‑side and reflected in the UI according to RMS usage rights.</p>\n<p></p>\n\n<p><b><b>Compliance considerations:</b></b></p>\n<p>No compliance considerations identified, review as appropriate for your organization.</p>",

      "Content": "<p>Updated January 12, 2026: We have updated the content. Thank you for your patience.</p><p>In response to customer feedback, we are introducing enhanced flexibility, greater scalability, and streamlined compliance management for private channels in Microsoft Teams.\n</p><p>Note: It is important for compliance managers to review and take appropriate action before migration starts for these changes to private channels. \n</p><p><b>What's changing?</b></p><p>Private channels will transition use a channel mailbox instead of individual user mailboxes. \n</p><p>Organizations with compliance policies (retention, legal hold, data loss prevention, or eDiscovery) for private channels must review these policies and must apply policies to the Microsoft 365 group for the channel’s team before migration begins to ensure continuity of the policy for a private channel.  Existing policies will continue to apply to user mailboxes; post-migration, new data will be governed by policies on the group. Note that policies applied to the team’s group can apply to all channels in the team.\n</p><p>After the transition to updated private channels in your organization, private channels will be updated as follows.\n</p><ol><li>Private channels are no longer limited to 30 per team. Instead, private channels can be added up to the limit of 1000 total channels per team.\n</li><li>Private channels can now have up to 5000 members, instead of 250.\n</li><li>Meetings can now be scheduled in private channels.\n</li><li>Compliance policies for private channels are part of the team’s group policies instead of the individual user level.\n</li></ol><p>The migration of private channels to the updated capabilities will begin in early October 2025 and continue through January 2026 (previously December 2025). During this period, private channels will continue to operate normally. Admins and compliance managers should complete any required policy changes by October 2025 (previosly September), before the migration begins. Changes to private channel limits and meeting scheduling will follow in February 2026. Migration can start or end at different times for each tenant during the rollout period. To track progress, a new PowerShell command will be available for tenants to check whether their migration has started or is completed. This post will be updated soon with details on the PowerShell command.</p><p>As part of this change, newly created private channels will not be created with a document library by default; the root folder is used as a default location for any new files.</p>\n</p><p><b>When this will happen:</b>\n</p><p>General Availability (Worldwide): We will begin rolling out private channel migration early October 2025 (previously late September) and expect to complete by late January 2026 (previously mid-December 2025). Updated channel limits and meeting scheduling will begin rollout in early February 2026 and we expect to complete by end of February 2026.</p><p><b>Action required by compliance managers and admins</b></p><ol><li>Purview eDiscovery and Legal Hold</li>\n<p></p><p>With this change, private channel data will move from user mailboxes to the group mailbox, aligning with how shared channels data is stored. Previously, legal holds were applied to user mailboxes since private channel data resided in each member’s mailbox. Post-migration, the latest version of private channel message data from each user’s mailbox is moved to the private channel’s group mailbox. Message edits and deleted messages will not be copied into the group mailbox.\n</p><p>Note: For users on hold, copies of message edits and deleted messages will remain in the user’s preserved library folder until the hold expires, while the latest version of private channel message data from each user’s mailbox is copied to the private channel’s group mailbox. \n</p><p>Before migration\n</p><p>If a legal hold exists for a private channel, admins must also apply the policy to the team’s group, in addition to the policy already applied to users’ mailboxes, in order for a hold to apply to new data generated and stored in the private channel’s mailbox. Note that policies applied to the team’s group can apply to all channels in the team.\n</p><p><img src=\"https://cxcs.microsoft.net/file/ccp/en-us/752d2d97-48d7-4491-a3e7-ecc866373a44  \" width=\"400\" height=\"\"></p><p>Screenshot 1: Setting up a new hold in Microsoft Purview compliance portal.\n</p><p>After migration\n</p><p>For existing holds admins will need to ensure that the hold is applied to the user mailbox as well as the new group mailbox, in order for a hold to apply to existing and new message data. Any new legal holds will need to be applied to the group.\n</p><p>For complete eDiscovery, include both the private channel’s users’ mailboxes and the team’s group mailbox to retrieve pre-migration messages, message history, and post-migration new content.\n</p><p><img src=\"https://cxcs.microsoft.net/file/ccp/en-us/0de1f667-c352-400b-8a94-57237676a30d  \" width=\"400\" height=\"\"></p><p>Screenshot 2: Configuring an eDiscovery search in Microsoft Purview compliance portal.\n</p><li>Purview Data Loss Prevention (DLP)</li> \n<p></p><p>With this change, private channel messages will be included as a part of the DLP policy scoped to the private channel’s team’s group, as opposed to the user mailbox. \n</p><p>Before migration\n</p><p>Admins must modify the “Teams chat and channel messages” policy for private channels to add the team’s group containing the private channel, in addition to the user mailbox, in order to include new private channel messages in a policy.

This update addresses the business need for secure, unattended automation in environments where (for example)<b>&nbsp;Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)</b> is enforced. With this enhancement, customers can run automation scripts using app identities, ensuring compliance with security policies while maintaining operational efficiency.</p>\n\n<p><b><b>When this will happen:</b></b></p>\n<p>This feature is now generally available.

In October 2026, the MERRL will go into enforcement for all cloud hosted mailboxes in the WWMT environment including existing tenants.</p><p style=\"margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:7.5pt;margin-left:0in\">Please refer to the ACS email documentation (Prepare an email communication resource for Azure Communication Services - An Azure Communication Services concept article | Microsoft Learn) or reach out to your Microsoft account team for further support in this journey.</p><p style=\"margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:7.5pt;margin-left:0in\"><b>Please note:</b> We have made the decision to not proceed with this change for DoD, GCC, or GCC High organizations at this time.

We have not enforced limiting of bulk email until now, but we plan on doing so with the introduction of an External Recipient Rate (ERR) limit. The ERR limit is being introduced to help reduce unfair usage and abuse of Exchange Online resources. </p><p><b>When this will happen:</b></p><p>The new ERR limit will be introduced in 2 phases:</p><p>Phase 1 - Starting April 1, 2026, (previously October 2025) the limit will apply to cloud-hosted mailboxes of trial tenants and all tenants created after this date.&nbsp;</p><p>Phase 2 – Starting October 1, 2026, (previously April 2026) we will start applying the limit to cloud-hosted mailboxes of existing tenants.&nbsp;</p><p> <b>How this will affect your organization:</b></p><p>Exchange Online enforces a Recipient Rate limit of 10000 recipients for cloud-hosted mailboxes. The 2000 ERR limit will become a sublimit within this 10000 Recipient Rate limit. There is no change to the Recipient Rate limit, and both of these will be rolling limits for 24-hour windows. You can send to up to 2,000 external recipients in a 24-hour period, and if you max out the external recipient rate limit then you will still be able to send to up to 8,000 internal recipients in that same period. If you don't send to any external recipients in a 24-hour period, you can send to up to 10,000 internal recipients.</p><p>For example:\n</p><ul><li>You use a cloud-hosted mailbox to send to 1,000 external recipients and 2,000 internal recipients at 6:00AM on Day 1, for a total of 3,000 recipients. You then send to another 1,000 external recipients at 8:00AM on Day 1. Because you sent to 2,000 external recipients, you will be blocked from sending to external recipients until 6:00AM on Day 2. During this period, you are able to send to up to 6,000 internal recipients, but for this example, let's assume that you don't.\n</li><li>At 6:00AM on Day 2, the 1,000 external recipients and 2,000 internal recipients sent at 6:00AM on Day 1 will no longer count toward the 24-hour limit calculation. Thus, from 6:00-8:00AM on Day 2, you can send to up to 9,000 total recipients (e.g., 9,000 internal or 8,000 internal plus 1,000 external).\n</li><li>If you don't send to any internal or external recipients during this period, then at 8:00AM on Day 2 you can again send to 10,000 recipients total with up to 2,000 of them being external recipients.</li></ul><p>\n</p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b><br></p><p>If you have a cloud-hosted mailbox that needs to exceed the ERR limit, you can move to <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/communication-services/concepts/email/email-overview\" target=\"_blank\">Azure Communication Services for Email</a>, which is designed specifically for high volume email sent to recipients external to your tenant.</p>",

Thank you for your patience.</p><p><b><b>Introduction</b></b></p>\n<p>In early 2026, a major update of Planner will begin rolling out. This update will introduce several new capabilities. In addition, several features will be retired from Microsoft Planner. These changes will <b>begin rolling out between mid-January</b> <b>2026 and mid-February 2026</b>. </p><p><b><b>When this will happen:</b></b></p><p>Refer to the sections below for details on timing.</p>\n<p><b><b>How this affects your organization:</b></b></p><p><b>Who is affected: </b>All users of Microsoft Planner in your organization, including those using Planner components in Loop, integrations with <b>Viva Goals</b>, and <b>premium Planner plans</b>.</p><p><b>What will happen:</b></p>\n<p>In early 2026, we will begin rolling out a new major update of the <b>Planner app in Teams</b>&nbsp;<b>desktop and web </b>as well as <b>Planner on the web</b>. This update will come with several new enhancements, and we will also be retiring several features at this time. See each section below for more detail on the timing.</p><p><b>New features in the upcoming Planner update:\n</b></p><ul><li>These changes will be available with the new update, which we expect to begin rolling out between mid-January 2026 and mid-February 2026.</li><li><b>Tasks chats in basic plans </b>will allow&nbsp;team members to collaborate directly on tasks using rich text formatting and @mentions, making it easier to discuss work and notify teammates about what needs attention.\n</li><li><b>Custom templates </b>will allow you to create reusable, pre-designed plan layouts tailored to your organization’s needs, ensuring consistency and saving time. They provide the ability to standardize content while allowing easy customization for specific scenarios.</li><li><b>Project manager agent </b>will now be available in all plans for M365 Copilot licensed users, including basic plans.</li></ul><p><b>Features in Planner that will be retired:</b></p>\n<ul><li>We expect this rollout to begin between <b>mid-January 2026</b> and <b>mid-February 2026</b>.</li><li>The following changes will take effect as this build rolls out to your organization:</li><ul><li><b>A new <i>Task chat experience </i>will replace the prior <i>comments experience </i>for <i>basic plan</i> tasks:</b> <ul><li>As noted above, the previous task comments experience will be replaced by a new task chat feature that supports messages about the task that can include @mentions and rich text formatting, in response to a longstanding top customer request. Due to customer feedback on our notifications experience, the new chat feature only sends an email/Teams notification to a colleague that’s been @mentioned in the message. </li><li>The task chat experience will be available on Planner in Teams web/desktop and the Planner web experience, and the old experience for viewing comments will no longer be directly visible on a task. Instead, the task details pane will show a link to open a page in Outlook where task comments can be seen.</li><li>Users can continue to use and see the previous task comments experience in the iOS Planner app, Android Planner app, and Planner in Teams mobile. New task chat messages will not be visible in the mobile experience at this time.</li><li>There are no changes to email notifications for the existing task comments experience, meaning that an email notification will be sent to all group members associated with the plan when a task comment is added.</li><li>There is no change to the <b>premium plan</b> conversations feature at this time.</li></ul></li><li><b>The whiteboard tab for <i>premium plans</i> will be retired.</b> <ul><li>This feature automatically created a whiteboard for <b>premium plans</b> in Planner and allowed users to create tasks in Planner from that whiteboard's sticky notes. </li><li>The <b>whiteboard tab</b> will be unavailable on the <b>premium plan</b> after retirement of this feature.</li><li>Users will be unable to create tasks from a whiteboard as a result. </li><li>Any existing whiteboard content will remain available via the <b>Whiteboard app</b>. </li><li>There is no replacement for this feature at this time.</li></ul></li></ul></ul><p><b>Features in Planner that will be temporarily unavailable:</b></p><ul><li>We expect this rollout to begin between <b>mid-January 2026</b> and <b>mid-February 2026</b>.</li><li><b>Convert a <i>basic plan</i> to a <i>premium plan</i>&nbsp;will be temporarily unavailable.</b></li><ul><li> The ability to convert an existing <b>basic plan</b> to a <b>premium plan</b> will be unavailable. </li><li>We plan to make similar functionality available again in the future. </li><li>In the meantime, users will need to create a new <b>premium plan</b> and manually copy the tasks into the new plan.</li></ul></ul><p><b>Features that will be retired as we pursue a long‑term plan to bring equivalent capabilities:</b></p><ul><li>Planner component in Loop pages.<ul><li>This control, which could previously be inserted by typing /planner in a Loop workspace or pasting the link to a Plan, was one of the available options. This control will be retired between mid-January 2026 and mid-February 2026.</li><li>Loop pages support various options for capturing task information. We recommend the Task List Control in Loop to capture tasks.</li><li>After the retirement of this control, which is expected to begin in January 2026 and will roll out independent of the Planner update rollout, it will no longer be possible to add a new component of this type in a Loop workspace.</li><li>Workspaces where these components were already present will display the Planner plan URL where the component was previously located.</li><li>Tasks previously entered in these components will remain available in Planner.</li></ul></li></ul><p>While the Planner component in Loop is being retired currently, we recognize the user need around a component like this for their planning needs. We have a longer-term goal to bring a similar Planner component across our M365 suite, including Loop. Considering these discussions are still in an early stage, we do not have an ETA to share currently.</p><p><b>&nbsp;Features outside of Planner that will be retired without replacement:</b></p><ul><li>Planner integration in Viva Goals.<ul><li>Viva Goals will be retired on December 31, 2025, as previously announced. Refer to Viva Goals retirement for more information.</li><li>When Viva Goals is retired, the entry point in Viva Goals for use with Planner will no longer be available.</li></ul></li><li>iCalendar feed integration retirement.<ul><li>This feature will be retired between mid-January 2026 and mid-February 2026.</li><li>This feature allowed users to subscribe to their Planner tasks as an iCalendar feed that could be viewed in iCalendar-compatible applications like Outlook.</li><li>After this feature is retired, users will not be able to create new iCalendar feeds for their tasks or plans, and they will stop seeing their tasks in the iCalendar feeds they previous created.</li><li>There is no replacement for this feature at this time.</li></ul></li></ul><p><b><b>What you can do to prepare:</b></b></p><ul><li>These changes will happen automatically by the specified dates.</li><li>No admin action is required.</li><li>Notify users about this change.<ul><li>Update relevant documentation as appropriate.</li><li>Share the recommended alternate options where appropriate, as described above.</li></ul></li></ul><p><b><b>Compliance considerations:</b>\n</b></p><p>No compliance considerations identified, review as appropriate for your organization.</p><p>\n</p><p>\n</p>",

As part of GA, customers with non-applicable parents will be auto migrated to the modern label scheme while migration for customers with applicable parents will continue to be opt-in for 12 months post-GA. We will auto-migrate customers with applicable parents to the modern label scheme once the 12-month extension ends in December 2026.&nbsp;</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b></p><p>During migration, to ensure label scoping integrity, any applicable parent label will be converted to a child label under a new label group, and then both parent and child label will have the same display name as the original parent label.

Role assignments will be synchronized between Purview roles and Entra roles without any customer action. This ensures that user permissions and identity flow securely from Purview to Microsoft 365.

This applies to both the full app and side pane experience. Thank you for your patience.</p><p>We're enhancing Microsoft 365 Copilot Chat with new capabilities that make it easier for users to include work content—such as files and emails—in their prompts. By typing ‘<b>/</b>’ in the prompt box, users can quickly search and reference relevant files or emails, streamlining prompt creation and improving Copilot responses. Additionally, some suggested prompts beneath the input box will now include relevant files or emails to help users get started quickly.</p><p><img src=\"https://cxcs.microsoft.net/static/public/messagecenter/neutral/e6d7449f-abbc-4ee6-b2b3-0b9f4c2a127a/2f8c1d1ae924ab9dd9b1edf74689e47553383208.png\" style=\"width: 25%;\"><br></p><p>Note: For users without a Microsoft 365 Copilot license, Copilot Chat is still grounded only in the web.

Storage location depends on the app’s architecture and may include Microsoft 365 or third-party services.</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Does the change alter how existing customer data is processed, stored, or accessed?</td><td>Apps now operate at the channel level, not the team level. This changes how data access and permissions are scoped, requiring updates to app manifests and use of channel-specific APIs.</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Does the change provide a new way of communicating between users, tenants, or subscriptions?</td><td>Apps (including bots and message extensions) within Private Channels enable new interaction paths among channel members, including guest users, depending on admin and app settings.</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Does the change modify, interrupt, or disable any of the following capabilities (Purview)?</td><td>Apps must be explicitly added per channel, which may affect how DLP policies, audit logging, and eDiscovery apply. Admins should validate app behavior in Private Channels to ensure compliance.</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Does the change alter how admins can monitor, report on, or demonstrate compliance activities?</td><td>Admins must review app usage and permissions at the channel level. Monitoring tools may need updates to reflect app activity in Private Channels.</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Does the change modify how users can access, export, delete, or correct their personal data within Microsoft 365 services (GDPR Data Subject Rights)?</td><td>Apps in Private Channels may store user interactions and data that must be considered in GDPR-related requests. Admins and developers should ensure data handling aligns with privacy obligations.</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Does the change include an admin control and, can it be controlled through Entra ID group membership?</td><td>Admins can manage app permissions and availability via Teams app policies and channel settings. Entra ID group membership may be used to scope access.</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Does the change allow a user to enable and disable the feature themselves?</td><td>Channel owners can control who can add apps, and users can interact with apps once added, subject to consent prompts and admin policies.</td></tr>\n</tbody></table></div>",

      "Content": "<p>We’re improving SharePoint Online security via Content Security Policy (CSP) enforcement. Currently CSP is applied in reporting mode but as of March 1, 2026, the Content Security Policy will be enforced which will prevent the loading of script (e.g. JavaScript) from non-allowed sources. This message center post replaces MC1055557 (April 2024).</p><p>This change is associated with Microsoft 365 Roadmap ID: <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?id=485797\" target=\"_blank\">485797</a></p><p><b>When this will happen:</b></p><p>This will be implemented starting March 1, 2026.</p><p>\n</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b></p><p>If your organization extended SharePoint Online using SPFx then the created custom SPFx solutions could potentially load scripts from locations which are not allowed. In most cases SPFx solutions use and load script from allowed locations, but that’s not always the case. Any script from a not allowed location will be blocked, the same applies for any inline script usage. SPFx solutions whose script is getting blocked will not function anymore as designed, impacting business scenarios depending on those solutions.\n</p><p>To prevent solutions from breaking there you need to:\n</p><ol><li>Ensure all used script locations are trusted script sources. This can be done without updating the SPFx solution\n</li><li>Move all inline script to script files which can then be defined as trusted source. <b>This will require updating the SPFx solution!\n</b></li></ol><p>If you need more time to review your SPFx solutions, there’s an option to postpone CSP enforcement by 90 days via below SPO Management Shell PowerShell cmdlet.\n</p><p><code>Set-SPOTenant -DelayContentSecurityPolicyEnforcement $true</code>\n</p><p>Note:\n</p><p>This option will be available in the SPO Management Shell version 16.0.26712.12000 (November 2025) or higher.\n</p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b></p><p>In addition to the default CSP settings, SharePoint Online will add locations listed in the Trusted Script Sources area of the SharePoint Online Admin Center as valid locations for CSP, thus enabling script loading from those locations. To add an entry, in a browser, go to the Trusted Script Sources via SharePoint Online Admin Center &gt; Advanced &gt; Script sources.\n</p><p><img src=\"https://cxcs.microsoft.net/file/ccp/en-us/65be05c0-aa60-4cd8-8c3d-cbf18cddbb73 \" width=\"400\" height=\"\"></p><p>To understand which script location to add there are two options. First option is testing your SPFx solutions with the browser dev tools console open. As CSP is in reporting mode until March 1, 2026, there will be messages indicating script that will be blocked once CSP is enforced. These messages start with “Loading the script '&lt;path to script&gt;' violates the following…” or “Executing inline script violates the following Content Security Policy directive…”. \n</p><p>Whenever the browser logs a CSP violation, that violation is also logged to <a href=\"https://purview.microsoft.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Microsoft Purview</a>. In the browser, navigate to the Audit solution in Microsoft Purview from the Microsoft 365 Admin Center. From the Search page, search for the Activity - friendly names value Violated Content Security Policy, or the Activity - operation names value ViolatedContentSecurityPolicy:\n</p><p><img src=\"https://cxcs.microsoft.net/file/ccp/en-us/ece7b2ac-44f9-4abe-b95f-426e20ab77bf \" width=\"400\" height=\"\"></p><p>Selecting a search result opens the side panel with the audit details. Take note of the following properties:</p><ul><li><b>DocumentUrl:</b> This indicates the page in the SharePoint Online site where the CSP violation occurred.</li><li><b>BlockedUrl:</b> This indicates the URL of the script that violated the CSP configuration or contains “inline” when the violation came from loading inline script\n</li></ul><p><img src=\"https://cxcs.microsoft.net/file/ccp/en-us/1818988a-08d8-4e41-802e-9abdc94ec2c5 \" width=\"400\" height=\"\"></p><p><b><u>Important\n</u></b></p><p>In the case of inline script, the remediation requires updating the SPFx solution by moving inline script into a separate script file, which then can be added as a trusted source.\n</p><p>Learn more: <a href=\"https://aka.ms/spfx/csp\" target=\"_blank\">Support for Content Security Policy (CSP) in SharePoint Online</a>&nbsp;</p>",

      "Content": "<p>Updated December 4, 2025: We have updated the timeline. Thank you for your patience.</p><p><b>Introduction</b></p><p>We hear your feedback about ways we can improve the notifications experience in Viva Engage. It's always a fine balance between ensuring your users are notified of relevant content without notifications feeling too overwhelming or noisy. In response to your feedback, we're rolling out an intelligent notifications experience. Specifically, this change will improve how <i>Community Announcement</i> notifications are delivered. This smarter delivery approach optimizes notifications delivery based on a user’s engagement behavior, helping to reduce notifications fatigue while ensuring timely visibility of announcements.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><b>When this will happen</b><b></b></p><p><b>General Availability (Worldwide): </b>We will begin rolling out this change in mid-September 2025 and expect the rollout to reach GA (General Availability) by end of January 2026.</p>\n\n<p><b>How this affects your organization</b>\n</p><p>Previously, when an admin created a new Community Announcement, this would send a notification in Teams and Mobile Push immediately, followed by an email notification two hours later if the announcement was not opened already in Teams and/or Mobile Push.&nbsp;\nWith this new update:\n</p><ul>\n<li>Users will now receive the notification in <b>one channel only</b>—either Teams, Mobile Push, or Email. This notification channel may differ by user and is selected based on where a user has engaged with Engage notifications most frequently in the past 30 days.&nbsp;</li><li>If the announcement is not opened within two hours in the first notification channel, a <b>secondary notification channel</b> will be sent, also determined by where a user engages with Engage notifications most frequently.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>We will continue to respect all user notification preferences and settings where applicable. If a notification channel is disabled or the app is not installed, it will not be selected as a potential notification channel for the Community Announcement delivery.</p><p>Note that this change applies only to<b> regular Community Announcements in Viva Engage</b> and does not affect the \"immediate\" Community Announcement feature (where admins can still select the checkbox to send emails immediately —this functionality remains unchanged).</p><p><b>Can I still notify Community users via email immediately (along with other notification channels)?&nbsp;</b></p><p>Yes! In Viva Engage, we offer an option to send an “immediate” Community Announcement. With this feature, Community admins can choose to send email notifications immediately after posting a Community Announcement, even if a user has opted out of receiving emails. All other notification channels will also send immediately along with email, including Teams and Mobile Push. Therefore, we recommend admins to use this feature when there is a Community Announcement that requires immediate attention from users.&nbsp;</p><p>Community Admins can find this “immediate” Community Announcement option by firstly navigating to the announcement publisher and selecting the hyperlinked <b><i>“option to send emails immediately” </i></b>at the bottom of the publisher. Upon clicking this option, an additional pop-up box will open called <i><b>“Immediate email delivery”</b></i>. By selecting this checkbox, this will ensure that all three notification channels – Email, Teams, and Mobile Push – will send to customers immediately after a Community Announcement is made.&nbsp;</p><p><b>\n&nbsp;What you can do to prepare</b>\n</p><p>No admin action is required. However, we recommend:\n</p><ul>\n<li>Informing your users about the new notifications change to reduce confusion</li>\n<li>Monitoring user feedback and engagement with <i>Community Announcements' notifications delivery</i></li>\n<li>Reviewing internal communication strategies to align with the new notification's behavior</li></ul><p></p><p></p>\n<table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n<tbody><tr><th>Compliance Area</th><th>Explanation</th></tr>\n<tr><td>Does the change alter how existing customer data is processed, stored, or accessed?</td><td>Yes. Notification delivery logic now uses user behavior data (last 30 days of notification engagement) to determine delivery channels. This data is used to personalize delivery but is not stored permanently.</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Does the change introduce or significantly modify AI/ML or agent capabilities that interact with or provide access to customer data?</td><td>Yes. The system uses behavioral data to determine the most effective notification channel, which is a form of machine learning-based personalization.</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Does the change provide a new way of communicating between users, tenants, or subscriptions?</td><td>Yes. The change modifies how users receive communications (Community Announcements) by introducing a dynamic, behavior-based delivery method.</td></tr>\n</tbody></table>",

      "Content": "<p>Updated December 4, 2025: We have updated the timeline. Thank you for your patience.\n</p><p>Please note that information about meeting link expiry changes related to this rollout has been added.</p><p>We are reducing the length of Microsoft Teams meeting URLs for easier sharing. This rollout applies to all Microsoft Teams platforms (Teams for iOS, Android, Mac, Teams devices, desktop, and web).</p><p>This message is associated with Microsoft 365 Roadmap ID <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?filters=&amp;searchterms=381953\" target=\"_blank\">381953</a>.\n</p><p><b>When this will happen:</b>\n</p><p>Targeted Release: We will begin rolling out mid-February 2025 (previously mid-January) and expect to complete by late February 2025 (previously late January). Only Meet Now use cases (except Meet Now in chats and channels) will be affected in this timeframe. There will be no impact on the scheduled meetings in this phase.</p><p>General Availability (Worldwide, GCC): We will begin rolling out January 2026 (previously mid-May 2025) and expect to complete by end of January 2026 (previously late May 2025). Only Meet Now use cases (except Meet Now in chats and channels) will be affected in this timeframe. There will be no impact on the scheduled meetings in this phase.&nbsp;</p><p>General Availability (GCC High, DoD):&nbsp; We will begin rolling out February 2026 (previously early August 2025) and expect to complete by end of February 2026 (previously late October 2025).</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b>\n</p><p>The new URL syntax is: https://teams.microsoft.com/meet/&lt;meeting_id&gt;?p=&lt;HashedPasscode&gt; \n</p><p>To make meeting URL shorter, we are removing several parameters such as tenant ID, conversation ID etc. This change serves two main goals: 1) improving usability of URL during sharing and 2) making the URL more secure and less susceptible to malicious attacks. \n</p><p>Here are some details about how meeting links work and when they expire: \n</p><ol><li>In case the meeting organizer gets removed from the tenant, the links to the meetings scheduled by them automatically expire. \n</li><li>&nbsp;Every meeting link expires in 60 days after the scheduled event or in 8 hours, if it was created as Meet Now. Learn more about expiration timelines for different types of meetings. \n</li></ol><p>With the Short Meeting URL release, expiration limit will be applied to all newly created links. \n</p><p>Once the change to Short Meeting URL is released, all newly created meetings will expire as described in the documentation: 60 days after meeting ends for scheduled meetings and 8 hours after creation for Meet Now. Once this expiry period is over, in case someone clicks the link (e.g. outside of Teams app OR in the meeting details inside Teams calendar section), they will be unable to join the meeting.</p><p>Note: Old links created before short meeting URL release will continue working as it previously was (user will be able to join even after the documented expiry limits).</p><p>The reason why we are making this change is simple: security is our topmost priority. Maintaining a high security level is essential to protect sensitive data, prevent financial losses, ensure business continuity, and meet compliance and legal obligations. It is a critical aspect of modern digital life and business operations. This adjustment is designed to enhance the security of Teams meeting links, thereby better safeguarding the customer tenant. We want to be on par with modern security standards, that’s why the new behavior is a step in the right direction that we must take. It’s not possible to keep the current behavior. If you think it breaks some of your business processes, please leave comment to the MC post and describe your case there. \n</p><p>Recommendations in case the meeting link has expired:  \n</p><p>For meeting organizer: We recommend scheduling a new meeting. If the meeting organizer got removed from the tenant someone else should reschedule their meetings from scratch. \n</p><p>For participant: Please reach out to the meeting organizer and ask them to reschedule the meeting or send you an updated link.</p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b>\n</p><p>You may want to check if you have any integrations that use parameters from URL. After the rollout, the URL will only contain the meeting ID. Parameters such as tenant ID, organizer ID, conversation ID and message ID will not be in the URL. \n</p><p>You may inform meeting organizers from your tenant who use expired meeting links, or you may want to make a tenant-wide announcement about this change. \n</p><p>This rollout will happen automatically by the specified date with no admin action required. You may want to notify your users about this change and update any relevant documentation as appropriate.</p>",

When this feature is configured and enabled, Teams can automatically update the work location of users who connect their laptop to your organization's Wi-Fi network or peripherals. The feature can leverage the mapping between your building names and your Wi-Fi networks to set the work location of your users to the right building. It can also leverage mappings to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/rooms/bookable-desks\" target=\"_blank\">specific peripherals</a>, such as monitors.

This capability also helps protect files as they egress from the original document library, such as for collaboration purposes or attempted exfiltration. Files downloaded from these libraries are protected at download. Users accessing these files outside of SharePoint Online have their rights evaluated in real time against the document library. Changes to user permissions on the document library are reflected on downloaded files, including full revocation for users removed from the document library. This provides a more streamlined way to revoke access to documents for individual users (instead of revoking access to each document).\n</p><p>Learn more about how to use this feature and its capabilities, limitations, and licensing: <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/purview/sensitivity-labels-sharepoint-extend-permissions\" target=\"_blank\">Configure SharePoint with a sensitivity label to extend permissions to downloaded documents | Microsoft Learn</a>\n</p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b>\n</p><p>After this feature is available, we recommend you test this feature first on sites with non-production data to understand its capabilities.\n</p><p>This rollout will happen automatically by the specified date with no admin action required before the rollout.

Thank you for your patience.&nbsp;</p><p><b>What it is</b></p><p>Microsoft is rolling out a new feature to streamline how app and agent availability is managed across Teams, Outlook, and Microsoft 365 Copilot. Until now, IT admins configured availability settings separately in both the Microsoft 365 Admin Center (MAC) and the Teams Admin Center (TAC), which led to mismatches. With this update, you’ll be able to unify availability policies for apps and agents across both portals, making app management more consistent and efficient<b>.</b></p><p>This message is associated with Microsoft 365 Roadmap ID <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?filters=&amp;searchterms=393931\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); font-family: sans-serif; font-weight: 400;\">393931</a>&nbsp;and <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?filters=&amp;searchterms=503105\" target=\"_blank\">503105</a>.</p><p><b>When this will happen:\n</b></p><p>We will begin rolling out this feature late September 2025 and expect to complete by end of June 2026 (previously mid-November 2025).</p><p>1. <b>Phase 1 – Default Tenant Unification</b></p><p>We will begin rolling out this feature at the end of September 2025. This initial phase targets tenants that have never modified their organization-wide defaults, app availability, or block/unblock in either the Microsoft 365 admin center or the Teams admin center.  At the end of this phase, agent and app manageability will be unified across both Microsoft 365 admin center and Teams admin center ensuring agent and Microsoft 365 <b>apps availability</b> policies are in alignment for all future administrative changes.

These tenants will be transitioned to a unified management experience across both Microsoft 365 and Teams admin centers.</p><ul><li><b>For tenants with no agent or app availability differences across both admin centers</b>, guidance will be provided to help maintain unified availability policy for all future changes. We will begin rolling out this feature in early November 2025.<br><ul><li>This message is associated with Microsoft 365 Roadmap ID <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?filters=&amp;searchterms=503105\">503105</a>.</li></ul></li><li><b>For tenants with agent or app availability differences across both admin centers, </b>a <b>wizard </b>in the Teams admin center will help identify affected agents and apps and guide through resolving discrepancies.<ul><li>As part of this phase we will also enable administrators to manage Microsoft 365 certified SaaS applications within their tenant through org-wide settings for third-party apps.

We will update this post with a timeline and more details later.</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization</b></p><p>Before this rollout, managing Teams apps that work in Outlook and the Microsoft 365 app was fragmented between the Integrated apps page in the Microsoft 365 admin center for Outlook and the Microsoft 365 app, and the Teams admin center for Teams. This sometimes resulted in different settings for the same app in the two admin centers. With Unified agent app management, you will be able to manage apps on the Integrated apps page in the Microsoft 365 admin center or in the Teams admin center, and any changes made in either admin center will synchronize.</p><div>What you can expect:\n</div><ul><li>You’ll gain a consolidated view of agent and Microsoft 365 app availability across both Microsoft 365 and Teams admin centers.\n</li><li>Changes made in either admin center to the agent and app availability will automatically apply across all supported hosts.\n</li><li>Organization-wide defaults for both admin centers will be in sync and govern app availability across Teams, Outlook, and the Microsoft 365 copilot app.</li></ul><p><b>&nbsp;What you need to do to prepare</b></p><p>To ensure a smooth transition, review your tenant-level and individual agent/app settings (app allow/block &amp; user availability) in both the Microsoft 365 Admin Center and the Teams Admin Center. If different departments within your organization manage these settings, we suggest coordinating efforts to complete the review collaboratively.\n</p><p>This update will be rolled out automatically by the stated date, and no immediate action is required. However, it's a good time to update any internal documentation related to agent and app management policies.&nbsp;</p><p>Learn more: <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/uam-tac-mac\" target=\"_blank\">Unified agent and app availability management across Microsoft 365 and Teams Admin Centers - Microsoft Teams | Microsoft Learn&nbsp;</a></p><p>\n</p>",

Thank you for your patience.&nbsp;</p><p><b>When this will happen:&nbsp;</b>Updated Rollout Schedule for iPhone and iPad</p><p>The first phase of this change is in-product notifications in the M365 Copilot app to encourage users who are editing documents to install the Word, PowerPoint, Excel apps. Users who try to browse files or manage their OneDrive libraries will be promoted to install the OneDrive app. This in-app notification will roll out to TestFlight users at the end of August and become generally available the week of September 15, 2025. This is a modification from the initial post to allow our enterprise customers more time to prepare.</p><p>The second phase of this change updates the Word, PowerPoint and Excel functionality in the Microsoft 365 Copilot app with previewers that will be made available to TestFlight users only in October and GA rollout will begin mid-October 2025. This will be a gradual, phased rollout that will take about 4 weeks or so to reach 100% of customers. These changes only apply to iPhone for now, iPad will see similar changes with a start of TestFlight in early November, and the start of the GA rollout in mid November. For iPad we will have a phased rollout that gradually ramps up to 100% of GA in about 4 weeks time.</p><p>To get early builds and test out features before GA dates – you will need to join the iOS TestFlight program for the Microsoft 365 Copilot app.  There are a limited number of seats available in the iOS TestFlight program. We periodically remove inactive users (those who have not updated their build) to make space for others. If you are unable to join because the program is full, please check back later, or contact your Microsoft Support representative.

Users will continue to be able to view files and use Copilot Chat to get deeper analysis and insights on their content. If a user needs to edit, the M365 Copilot app will transition to the standalone Word, Excel, or PowerPoint apps. Users of the M365 Copilot app will continue to be able to browse and search recent files in the app, but users seeking comprehensive file management features will be encouraged to utilize the OneDrive app. When users land in the M365 Copilot app Search experience and navigate to the My files, Libraries, or My device entry points a notification will appear promoting the use of the OneDrive app for these actions.\n</p><p>Detailed Change Log: Word, Excel, PowerPoint, M365 Copilot App \n</p><ul><li>Word, Excel, PowerPoint: The Microsoft 365 Copilot app for iPhone and iPad will a provide a Copilot powered preview experience for documents. Users can view content and use Copilot Chat for file queries. Users who wish to edit the file will be prompted to open or install the standalone apps.\n</li><li>M365 Copilot App: The M365 Copilot app has evolved to an AI-first productivity assistant that brings together productivity activity across Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook and other Microsoft 365 apps. It gives your users the power of file previews and M365 Copilot chat in an experience that inherits all the security, identity and privacy policies you’ve set up in Microsoft 365.</li><li>Teams, OneDrive, Outlook iOS app integration: These apps on iPhone and iPad will continue to show users a preview of their Word, Excel and PowerPoint files. If users want to open and edit a Word, Excel, or PowerPoint file, they will now be directed to the respective standalone Word, Excel or PowerPoint app. The M365 Copilot app will no longer handle file open and edit operations from Teams, OneDrive or Outlook.</li><li> File Management: Searching for files within the M365 Copilot app will remain available.

This message serves as a reminder as we begin a broader rollout of the feature announced in 2023.</p><p>\n</p><p><b>When this will happen:</b></p><p>Ongoing rollout.&nbsp;</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b></p><p>When rolled out, users within your organization will be able to directly initiate a Teams Premium trial. These self-service trial licenses will be a part of your Microsoft organizational tenant, and you will be able to manage these licenses like other Microsoft subscriptions. You will be able to cancel these trial licenses at any time.</p><p>You will also be able to fully control whether trials are converted to paid subscriptions. Users will not need to input payment information when signing up. If a user would like to convert to a paid license, they must work with you directly to do so as there is no auto-renew functionality for these trials. If a user isn’t upgraded to a paid subscription, all services included in their Microsoft Teams Premium will end, and the user may lose read only access to data generated by Teams Premium, stored in Microsoft Teams, OneDrive, and SharePoint.<br></p><p>Users in tenants where self-service trials are disabled may still see the “Get Premium” prompt when accessing features that require a premium license. This is expected behavior and helps signal user interest to admins. It can also help identify which users in your organization may need a Teams Premium license, allowing you to better manage and allocate your available licenses.&nbsp; To reduce confusion and prevent users from submitting license requests, admins can customize the license request flow. Instead of showing the default request form, they can configure a custom message explaining that license requests are not supported in their organization.

This new integration leverages DLM features to provide an additional control for Adaptive protection that automatically preserves items deleted by a user with an elevated risk level, so items can be restored if needed.</p><p>This message is associated with Microsoft 365 Roadmap ID <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?filters=&amp;searchterms=392839\" target=\"_blank\">392839</a>.\n</p><p><b>When this will happen:</b>\n</p><p>Public preview: We will begin rolling out in late June 2024 (previously early May) and expect to complete by late July 2024 (previously mid-July).\n</p><p>General Availability:&nbsp; We will begin rolling out late June 2026 (previously early February 2026) and expect to complete by late June 2026 (previously early February 2026).</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b>\n</p><p>After the rollout, and after you enable Adaptive protection for your tenant, the retention label and auto-apply policy for data lifecycle management will be automatically created for you. This policy will automatically include elevated risk users identified by Microsoft Purview | Insider Risk Management solution. If these users delete content from Microsoft SharePoint, Microsoft OneDrive, or Microsoft Exchange, a retention label is automatically applied to that content to retain it for 120 days. Retention labels are automatically applied to unlabeled content deleted by these users. When these users are no longer at the elevated risk level, they are automatically removed from the DLM policy, and the system will no longer keep a copy of content they delete. Any content copies previously retained when the user had an elevated risk level will be kept for the 120 days as specified by the retention label.\n</p><p>Unlike other retention labeling scenarios, users do not see the retention label, and you do not need to create or manage the retention label or policy. At this time, you can't change the retention period or assign different policies based on the different risk levels, or for different locations. The single retention label and auto-labeling policy for your tenant is not visible in the Microsoft Purview compliance portal.</p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b>\n</p><p>Learn more: <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/purview/retention#dynamically-mitigate-the-risk-of-accidental-or-malicious-deletes\" target=\"_blank\">Learn about retention policies &amp; labels to retain or delete | Microsoft Learn</a>\n</p><p>If you're using Adaptive protection and want to automatically retain content deleted by elevated risk users, follow these steps to turn on this new integration.\n</p><ol><li>Sign in to the <a href=\"https://compliance.microsoft.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Microsoft Purview compliance portal</a>.\n</li><li>Navigate to <i>Data lifecycle management &gt; Microsoft 365 &gt; Adaptive protection settings</i> in the top right corner.\n</li><li>Turn the setting ON and select <i>Save</i>.\n</li></ol><p>\n</p><p><img src=\"https://cxcs.microsoft.net/file/messagecenter/en-us/fe6a20ed-77ce-44ce-b862-bc7f4b78b93e\" style=\"width: 400px;\" alt=\"admin settings\">\n</p><p><img src=\"https://cxcs.microsoft.net/file/messagecenter/en-us/521b359c-13a9-41ef-ad96-215789a32eb3\" style=\"width: 400px;\" alt=\"admin settings\">\n</p><p>If you’re not using Adaptive protection already, turn on Adaptive protection and the new feature will be enabled along with Adaptive protection.\n</p><p>This rollout will happen automatically by the specified date with no admin action required before the rollout.

Thank you for your patience.</p><p><b>Introduction\n</b></p><p>We’re introducing a new Workflows experience in Microsoft Teams that is rebuilt from the ground up based on feedback.&nbsp;</p><p>The Workflows app helps you automate repetitive tasks and streamline everyday processes across Teams and Microsoft 365. Whether you're scheduling messages, managing approvals, syncing updates across apps, or triggering actions from chat messages, Workflows makes it easy to build automations in just a few clicks. It’s powered by Power Automate and designed to help you stay focused on what matters most.</p><p>This new version addresses previous concerns around complexity and performance, delivering a faster, more intuitive, and streamlined interface. With the updated experience, users can now create powerful automations in three steps or fewer.</p><p>This release is part of our broader effort to make automation more accessible and impactful for every information worker. Whether you're new to automation or a seasoned pro, the new Workflows app is designed to meet you where you work—and help you get more done with less effort.

Thank you for your patience.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>Microsoft Purview Insider Risk Management (IRM) will be adding a new role--Data Security Investigation Contributor--to the Insider Risk Management Investigators role group. This will allow members of the Insider Risk Management Investigators role group to launch   a Data Security Investigation (DSI) from an IRM case.</p><p>DSI is a new AI-powered solution that enables data security teams to identify incident-related data, conduct deep content analysis, and mitigate risk within one unified solution. DSI enables data security admins to efficiently identify incident-relevant content by searching their Microsoft 365 data estate to locate emails, Teams messages, Copilot prompts and responses, and documents. Once the investigation is scoped, DSI’s generative AI capabilities allow admins to gain deeper insights into the impacted data, revealing critical security risks and sensitive information. Investigative capabilities include the ability to categorize evidence, perform vector searches, and examine impacted data for security and sensitive data risks. DSI visualizes correlations between investigation data, users, and their activities. To mitigate identified risks, DSI facilitates secure collaboration between partner teams. Post-investigation learnings can be used to refine existing policies to strengthen an organization's security practices.  \n</p><p>The integration between IRM and DSI allows an IRM investigator to identify when a risky user needs deeper investigation to launch a pre-scoped investigation directly from the user activity pane, allowing them to view content analysis related to that user and better assess post-incident data impact.  \n</p><p>This message is associated with roadmap ID  <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?rtc=1%26filters%3D&amp;searchterms=485707\" target=\"_blank\">485707</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>\n</p><p><b>When this will happen:</b>\n</p><p>Public Preview (Worldwide): We will begin rolling out early April 2025 and expect to complete by late April 2025.</p><p>General Availability (Worldwide): We will begin rolling out in mid-October 2025 (previously mid-July) and expect to complete by mid-December 2025 (previously mid-August).</p><p> \n</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b> \n</p><p>With this update, members of the Insider Risk Management Investigators role group will be able to create Data Security Investigations from an Insider Risk Management case.

Thank you for your patience.</p><p>Coming soon: A new integration between Insider Risk Management (IRM) and Data Security Investigation (DSI) in Microsoft Purview. This enhancement allows data security admins to launch a pre-scoped DSI directly from an IRM case, enabling deeper investigation into risky user behavior and better post-incident impact assessment.</p><p>DSI is a new AI-powered solution that enables data security teams to identify incident-related data, conduct deep content analysis, and mitigate risk within one unified solution. DSI enables data security admins to efficiently identify incident-relevant content by searching their Microsoft 365 data estate to locate emails, Teams messages, Copilot prompts and responses, and documents. Once the investigation is scoped, DSI’s generative AI capabilities allow admins to gain deeper insights into the impacted data, revealing critical security risks and sensitive information. Investigative capabilities include the ability to categorize evidence, perform vector searches, and examine impacted data for security and sensitive data risks. To mitigate identified risks, DSI facilitates secure collaboration between partner teams. Post-investigation learnings can be used to refine existing policies to strengthen an organization's security practices.\n</p><p>This message is associated with Microsoft 365 Roadmap ID <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?filters=&amp;searchterms=486827\" target=\"_blank\">486827</a>.</p><p><b>When this will happen:</b></p><p>Public Preview: We will begin rolling out mid-July 2025 and expect to complete by late July 2025.\n</p><p>General Availability (Worldwide): We will begin rolling out late November 2025 (previously late August) and expect to complete by late December 2025 (previously late September).\n</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b>\n</p><p>After this rollout:</p><ul><li>Members of the Insider Risk Management Investigators role group can initiate a DSI directly from an IRM case.\n</li><li>However, they must also be assigned the Data Security Investigation Investigator role to view the investigation results.\n</li><li>This streamlines the investigation process by allowing admins to:<ul><li>Go to Purview compliance portal &gt; IRM</li><li>Go to <i>Cases</i>, and open any case listed</li><li>Select <i>Case actions</i>\n</li><li>Choose <i>Investigate data security with AI </i>from the dropdown menu\n</li><li>Name the investigation and select relevant content\n</li><li>Launch the investigation with a single click</li></ul></li></ul><p>This change will be available by default.\n</p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b>\n</p><p>This rollout will happen automatically by the specified date with no admin action required before the rollout.

Please review the below.</p><p>We are implementing the following changes to custom scripting and classic publishing in SharePoint Online.</p><p><b>1. Disablement of custom scripting</b></p><p>Custom scripting will be disabled by default (setting DenyAddAndCustomizePages to 1 or $true) for sites created with the following templates:</p><ul><li>BLANKINTERNETCONTAINER#0 = Classic Publishing Portal Site\n</li><li>CMSPUBLISHING#0 = Classic Publishing Site\n</li><li>BLANKINTERNET#0 = Classic Publishing Site Blank</li><li>CSPCONTAINER#0 = SharePoint Embedded Site</li></ul><p>NOTE:\n</p><ul><li>Existing classic publishing sites created with the templates listed above will have custom scripting disabled by default. \n</li><li>Disabling custom scripting does not affect the execution of scripts that have already been added to a site or page.</li></ul><p>Refer to <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/sharepoint/security-considerations-of-allowing-custom-script\" target=\"_blank\">this documentation</a> to learn more about the security considerations of ungoverned scripting.</p><p><b>2. Ability to set site property bag valued without requiring custom scripting enablement.</b></p><p>Users no longer need to set DenyAddAndCustomizePages to $false or 0 (i.e. enable custom scripting) in a site to manage site property bag values. We have introduced a new AllowWebPropertyBagUpdateWhenDenyAddAndCustomizePagesIsEnabled setting at the site level and at the tenant level to allow adding/managing site property bag values. Please see documentation here for <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/module/sharepoint-online/set-spotenant?view=sharepoint-ps#-allowwebpropertybagupdatewhendenyaddandcustomizepagesisenabled\" target=\"_blank\">tenant level setting</a>&nbsp;and here for <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/module/sharepoint-online/set-sposite?view=sharepoint-ps#-allowwebpropertybagupdatewhendenyaddandcustomizepagesisenabled\" target=\"_blank\">the site level setting.</a>&nbsp;</p><p><b>3. Classic publishing sites creation and feature activation changes</b></p><p>Users will no longer be able to create new classic publishing related site collections or activate publishing features in existing site collections.

Thank you for your patience.</p><p>In 2018, <a href=\"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/exchange-team-blog/upcoming-changes-to-exchange-web-services-ews-api-for-office-365/ba-p/608055\" target=\"_blank\">we announced</a> that we were no longer making feature updates to Exchange Web Services (EWS) in Exchange Online, and we advised developers to move to Microsoft Graph. </p><p>In September 2023, we announced that on October 1, 2026, we will start blocking EWS requests to Exchange Online. \n</p><p>\n</p><p>We are now less than 18 months from October 1, 2026. We have made progress on closing several parity gaps with more changes in development to be released in the coming quarters. Please refer to <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/exchange/clients-and-mobile-in-exchange-online/deprecation-of-ews-exchange-online\" target=\"_blank\">Deprecation of Exchange Web Services in Exchange Online</a> for up-to-date guidance and roadmap information.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>If you haven't already, start the process of working with your application development organization and your application vendors to migrate active EWS applications on your tenant to the Graph API.&nbsp;</p><p>\n</p><p><b>When this will happen:</b></p><p>October 1, 2026</p><p><b>How this affects your organization:</b></p><p>While the EWS components of the service will continue to receive security updates and certain non-security updates, product design and features will remain unchanged. This change also applies to the EWS SDKs for Java and .NET, as well.\n</p><p>Despite this announcement, EWS is still available and supported for use in production environments. But we strongly suggest migrating to Microsoft Graph to access Exchange Online data and gain access to the latest features and functionality.\n</p><p>Today’s update and the retirement of EWS apply only to Microsoft 365 and Exchange Online (all environments); there are no changes to EWS in Exchange Server. Further, the changes in Exchange Online do not affect Outlook for Windows or Mac, Teams, or any other Microsoft product.</p><p>In our original blog post, we said this change would affect only third-party (non-Microsoft) applications.<b> We have expanded our effort and are now also removing EWS dependencies from Microsoft apps and services, and we’re going to complete that work well before October 2026</b>. We intend to do this as quickly as possible without affecting the quality of service or product.&nbsp;</p><p>There may be applications running on your tenant created by your organization or 3rd parties that use EWS. <b>We recommend <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/admin/activity-reports/ews-usage?view=o365-worldwide\" target=\"_blank\">reviewing your application portfolio</a> now </b>to get an understanding of which apps need to be updated by your organization and which applications require updates from vendors.</p><p>It is important to get started with this effort as soon as possible as the Graph API patterns are quite different from EWS. Equivalent Graph API operations may exhibit subtle differences that affect your use cases and application designs in unanticipated ways.</p><p>Migrating Applications to Microsoft Graph&nbsp;</p><p>We know there are several feature gaps between EWS and Microsoft Graph, and though the list below is not exhaustive, these are the gaps most frequently reported to us by developers:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Access to Archive Mailboxes – We are working on delivering access to archive mailboxes via Microsoft Graph and will provide an updated timeline in the coming months.\n</li><li>Folder Associated Information / User Configuration – We are working on these features and will provide an updated timeline in the coming months.\n</li><li>Exchange Online Management – We are investigating solutions for this and will provide an updated timeline in the coming months.</li><li>Access to Public Folders – After evaluating the usage of public folders, we have decided to restrict programmatic access to public folders to supported Outlook clients only, and for bulk import/export purposes. We will not provide APIs for programmatically creating, reading, updating and deleting public folders after October 2026 (also see <a href=\"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/exchange/security-related-updates-in-exchange-online/4303525\" target=\"_blank\">Security Related Updates in Exchange Online</a>).&nbsp;</li></ul><div><br></div><p>We know there are other gaps not listed above, and we continue to work on closing them, but it’s possible some functionality will not make it to Microsoft Graph. We encourage you to refer to <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/exchange/clients-and-mobile-in-exchange-online/deprecation-of-ews-exchange-online\" target=\"_blank\">Deprecation of Exchange Web Services in Exchange Online</a> for up-to-date guidance and roadmap information.&nbsp;</p><p><b>Next Steps\n</b></p><p>The retirement of these APIs follows our <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/lifecycle/policies/modern\" target=\"_blank\">Modern Lifecycle Policy</a>. We understand changes like this may cause some inconvenience, but we are confident it will ensure more secure, reliable, and performant experiences.\n</p><p>We will publish regular communications as we progress towards this deadline to aid affected tenants in identifying EWS usage. We encourage all customers to monitor Message Center and the Exchange Blog and <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/exchange/clients-and-mobile-in-exchange-online/deprecation-of-ews-exchange-online\" target=\"_blank\">Deprecation of Exchange Web Services in Exchange Online </a>for related content.&nbsp;</p><p>Thank you in advance for updating and opening your apps to a wider range of useful and intelligent features on Microsoft Graph.
