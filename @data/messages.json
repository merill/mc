Once connected, users will be able to generate slides using branded images from your organization’s asset library, helping ensure brand consistency.</p><p>This feature will be available by default for admins to configure. If no enterprise image library is connected, the option to use branded images will be disabled in the image source menu, and only Microsoft 365 images will be available.</p><p><b>Sharepoint OAL setup</b></p><p>To enable this feature with SharePoint OAL, admins must:\n</p><ul><li>Create an organization asset library in SharePoint for your company’s brand images.\n</li><li>Run a Microsoft PowerShell command to connect the image library to Microsoft 365 Copilot.\n</li><li>Ensure that images include robust metadata (keywords, titles, and alt-text) to support searchability.</li></ul><p><b>Templafy setup</b></p><p>To enable this feature with Templafy, admins must:\n</p><ul><li>Have an active Templafy account configured with your company’s brand assets.\n</li><li>Enable the Microsoft Graph Connector in your Templafy account settings to establish the Copilot connection.\n</li><li>Ensure that images include robust metadata (keywords, titles, and alt-text) to support searchability.\n</li></ul><p>Once setup is complete, users can select the <b>New Slide Copilot </b>icon in the PowerPoint ribbon, enter a prompt, and choose their preferred image source—either Microsoft 365 images or their organization’s branded image library—via the <b>Image Source</b> menu.</p><p>Admins can email <b>pptentimg_admin@microsoft.com</b> to request connection of their enterprise assets to Copilot in PowerPoint.</p><p><b>Note:</b> We recommend enabling this feature only if your image library contains more than 1,000 images with robust metadata.</p><p><i>After setup, the option to select branded images from your organization’s library will be enabled when generating slides with Copilot in PowerPoint:</i><i>&nbsp;</i><img src=\"https://cxcs.microsoft.net/static/public/messagecenter/neutral/195faa33-9c46-410a-bfc6-393352b66e85/d31f900110e856899061e91fc31b46377dfcbe24.png\" alt=\"user settings\" style=\"width: 500px;\"></p><p></p><p><i>Copilot in PowerPoint allows users to enter a prompt and choose image sources, including your organization’s branded image library, if connected.:&nbsp;</i><img src=\"https://cxcs.microsoft.net/static/public/messagecenter/neutral/848e711e-6c2d-4cd2-b543-d93c710735c9/ea7cf97b017f9729f3b02510c3e97cab8e7cd62d.png\" style=\"width: 500px;\" alt=\"user settings\"></p><p></p><p><b>What you can do to prepare:\n</b></p><p>Admins should:\n</p><ul><li>Notify brand managers of this new capability.\n</li><li>Decide if you'd like to connect SharePoint OAL or Templafy to Copilot.

      "Content": "<p>Updated August 27, 2025: We have updated the content. Thank you for your patience.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;In 2023, we introduced Microsoft Teams apps that are compatible with Microsoft Outlook and the Microsoft 365 App (manifest version v1.13 or higher). Before this rollout, admin changes made in the Integrated apps section of the Microsoft 365 admin center would only affect these Teams apps in Outlook and the Microsoft 365 app. Similarly, changes made in the Teams admin center would exclusively affect Teams. Starting in June 2024, we will roll out Unified App Management to streamline the management of these apps across Teams, Outlook and the Microsoft 365 App, so they are consistently available across all supported clients.</p><p>This message is associated with Microsoft 365 Roadmap ID <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?filters=&amp;searchterms=393931\" target=\"_blank\">393931</a>.\n</p><p><b>When this will happen:</b>\n</p><p>This rollout will happen in two major phases. Unified App Management can apply only to tenants that have migrated to app centric management in Teams admin center, as communicated in MC688930 <i>(Updated) Teams admin center: App centric management and changes to app permission policies</i> (November 2023).\n</p><ul><li>Phase 1 | General Availability (Worldwide): We will begin rolling out this feature end of September 2025. This initial phase targets tenants that have never modified their organization-wide defaults, app availability, or block/unblock in either the Microsoft 365 admin center or the Teams admin center.  At the end of this phase, agent and app manageability will be unified across both Microsoft 365 admin center and Teams admin center ensuring agent and M365 apps availability configuration policies are in alignment for all future administrative changes.</li><li>Phase 2: We will update this post with a timeline and more details in August 2025 (previously May 2025).&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ul><p>\n</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b>\n</p><p>Before this rollout, managing Teams apps that work in Outlook and the Microsoft 365 app was fragmented between the <i>Integrated app</i>s page in the Microsoft 365 admin center for Outlook and the Microsoft 365 app, and the Teams admin center for Teams. This sometimes resulted in different settings for the same app in the two admin centers. With Unified App Management, we will be consolidating app catalog management into a single platform. You will be able to manage apps on the <i>Integrated apps</i> page in the Microsoft 365 admin center or in the Teams admin center, and any changes made in either admin center will synchronize.\n</p><p><i>What you can expect</i>\n</p><ol><li>App catalog enhancements: Apps will start showing hosts where they are available: Teams, Outlook, or the Microsoft 365 app. \n</li><li>Organization-wide settings: App availability default settings will now apply to apps used in Teams, Outlook, and Microsoft 365 app.\n</li><li>App installs: Apps deployed from the Integrated apps page in Microsoft 365 admin center will be preinstalled in all applicable hosts for the app. Unlike app preinstallation in the Teams App setup policy, new app installs will provide access to the preinstalled apps, similar to deploying the app for Outlook and the Microsoft 365 App.. For more details on app deployment, refer to MC795355 Microsoft Teams admin center: App centric management for app installation and changes to app setup policies (May 2024)].</li><li>App availability: Managing app availability will apply to all applicable app hosts. \n</li><li>App block/unblock: Blocking or unblocking apps will apply to all applicable app hosts. \n</li><li>Consolidation of existing app settings: All existing app settings will be unified between Integrated apps (MAC) and Manage apps (TAC) pages. Merge rules can be found in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/MicrosoftTeams/manage-apps-across-m365\" target=\"_blank\">Manage apps that work across Teams, Outlook, and Microsoft 365 | Microsoft Learn</a>. These changes cannot be rolled back.\n</li><li>Consolidation report: After further review we have decided not to proceed with this change at this time. We apologize for any inconvenience.</li></ol><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b>\n</p><p>We recommend that you review app and tenant settings in the Microsoft 365 admin center and the Teams admin center. If these are managed by different departments in your organization, we recommend conducting these reviews collaboratively.\n</p><p>We also recommend that you review the merge rules and consider their potential impact on apps in your organization. Make any necessary adjustments to unify them in advance, if the merge rules in this message do not align with your expectations.\n</p><p>This rollout will happen automatically by the specified date with no admin action required before the rollout. You may want to update any relevant documentation as appropriate.\n</p>",

Users will continue to be able to view files and use Copilot Chat to get deeper analysis and insights on their content. If a user needs to edit, the M365 Copilot app will transition to the standalone Word, Excel, or PowerPoint apps. Users of the M365 Copilot app will continue to be able to browse and search recent files in the app, but users seeking comprehensive file management features will be encouraged to utilize the OneDrive app. When users land in the M365 Copilot app Search experience and navigate to the My files, Libraries, or My device entry points a notification will appear promoting the use of the OneDrive app for these actions.\n</p><p>Detailed Change Log: Word, Excel, PowerPoint, M365 Copilot App \n</p><ul><li>Word, Excel, PowerPoint: The Microsoft 365 Copilot app for iPhone and iPad will a provide a Copilot powered preview experience for documents.

As part of this change, users will be prompted to open the standalone Word, Excel, and PowerPoint apps to edit their files.

This change ensures a consistent and secure brand experience across all surfaces and completes the transition from Yammer to Viva Engage.</p><p>This update was previously communicated in MC679739, “Yammer Rebranding to Viva Engage Domain Migration Update,” in October 2023.</p><p><b>When this will happen</b></p><ul><li>The email sender domain rollout will begin in early September 2025 (previously late August) for U.S. and EU tenants currently receiving messages from @yammer.com and @eu.yammer.com respectively. The entire rollout is expected to complete by the end of October 2025.\n</li><li>A fallback/coexistence period will be in place between September (previously August) and the end of October, during which both the old and new domains will be supported. During this time, some users within a tenant may receive emails from the old domain while others receive them from the new domain.</li></ul><p></p><p><b>How this will affect your organization</b></p><p>The sender domain for Viva Engage emails will change as follows:\n</p><ul><li>From @yammer.com to @engage.mail.microsoft for U.S. and global regions.\n</li><li>From @eu.yammer.com to @eu.engage.mail.microsoft for European regions.\n</li></ul><p>These new domains are secured with industry-standard authentication protocols (e.g., SPF) to help prevent spoofing and ensure reliable delivery.\n</p><p>To enhance security and reduce cross-tenant spam, sender addresses will now include a tenant-specific prefix.

Thank you for your patience.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;We’re making some changes to DNS provisioning of A records for all new Accepted Domains provisioned after October 1st, 2025 (previously August 1st). Between early and late October 2025 (previously early August and late August), we will gradually switch provisioning of all A records for new Accepted Domains into the new subdomains under mx.microsoft.</p><p>We are doing this to reduce the friction of adopting DNSSEC in the long run. DNSSEC is a set of extensions to DNS that provides cryptographic verification of DNS records, preventing DNS spoofing and adversary-in-the-middle attacks to DNS.\n</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b>\n</p><p>After October 1st, 2025 (previously August 1st), all A records for new Accepted Domains will be provisioned into the new subdomains under mx.microsoft.\n</p><p>DNS resolution will safely fallback to “plain” DNS if a domain is not DNSSEC enabled. If an Accepted Domain you add to the Exchange Admin Center after October 1st (previously August 1st) is not secured with DNSSEC at the domain level (ex. contoso.com), then DNS resolution will work as usual. If an Accepted Domain you add to the EAC after October 1st (previously August 1st) is secured with DNSSEC, then DNSSEC will extend to the mx.microsoft DNS record automatically and you will get the benefits of DNSSEC without having to take any further action. Any issues with DNSSEC can be addressed by disabling DNSSEC for the Accepted Domain (ex. contoso.com) via your DNS provider.\n</p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b>\n</p><p>If you have any automation in place, for example in workflows for Domain Setup, for MX record creation that expects A records for newly provisioned Accepted Domains to be provisioned in mail.protection.outlook.com, this automation needs to be updated by October 1st (previously August 1st) to use List serviceConfigurationRecords Graph API (<a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/graph/api/domain-list-serviceconfigurationrecords?view=graph-rest-1.0&amp;tabs=http\" target=\"_blank\">List serviceConfigurationRecords</a>). Use List serviceConfigurationRecords to retrieve the mailExchange value for your MX record. After October 1st (previously August 1st), List serviceConfigurationRecords Graph API will be the only source of truth for your Accepted Domains’ MX record value. You will not be able to rely on the Accepted Domain’s A record being provisioned in mail.protection.outlook.com after October 1st (previously August 1st.</p><p>If you are using automation that expects the record to end with mail.protection.outlook.com, when you add a new Accepted Domain to the Exchange Admin Center after October 1st (previously August 1st), mail flow may not work upon initial configuration and you will have to update your MX record to match what the Exchange Admin Center says for the domain or use the mailExchange value returned by List serviceConfigurationRecords Graph API.\n</p><p>If you expect this change to cause any issues for your organization, please share that feedback. \n</p><p><br></p>",

Please review the below.</p><p>We are implementing the following changes to custom scripting and classic publishing in SharePoint Online.</p><p><b>1. Disablement of custom scripting</b></p><p>Custom scripting will be disabled by default (setting DenyAddAndCustomizePages to 1 or $true) for sites created with the following templates:</p><ul><li>BLANKINTERNETCONTAINER#0 = Classic Publishing Portal Site\n</li><li>CMSPUBLISHING#0 = Classic Publishing Site\n</li><li>BLANKINTERNET#0 = Classic Publishing Site Blank</li><li>CSPCONTAINER#0 = SharePoint Embedded Site</li></ul><p>Refer to <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/sharepoint/security-considerations-of-allowing-custom-script\" target=\"_blank\">this documentation</a> to learn more about the security considerations of ungoverned scripting.</p><p><b>2. Ability to set site property bag valued without requiring custom scripting enablement.</b></p><p>Users no longer need to set DenyAddAndCustomizePages to $false or 0 (i.e. enable custom scripting) in a site to manage site property bag values. We have introduced a new AllowWebPropertyBagUpdateWhenDenyAddAndCustomizePagesIsEnabled setting at the site level and at the tenant level to allow adding/managing site property bag values. Please see documentation here for <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/module/sharepoint-online/set-spotenant?view=sharepoint-ps#-allowwebpropertybagupdatewhendenyaddandcustomizepagesisenabled\" target=\"_blank\">tenant level setting</a>&nbsp;and here for <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/module/sharepoint-online/set-sposite?view=sharepoint-ps#-allowwebpropertybagupdatewhendenyaddandcustomizepagesisenabled\" target=\"_blank\">the site level setting.</a>&nbsp;</p><p><b>3.

You and your team can add comments and make changes together, and AutoSave keeps your work updated in real time. \n</li><li>Never lose your progress: Don’t worry about losing your work—files in the Cloud include AutoSave on, meaning your documents are automatically saved for you as you work.​ \n</li><li>Access from anywhere: Files you create in Word, Excel, or PowerPoint on Windows are instantly available from your Mac, web browser, iPhone, or Android device.

Admins can customize this threshold as needed (minimum allowed is 5) in the Manager settings tab of the Viva insights web app.\n</li><li>If your organization has already enabled manager insights and set a minimum team size threshold, those settings will continue to apply. Managers who meet the threshold and are enabled by Admins will automatically gain access to the new capabilities in the Viva Insights web app.&nbsp;</li><li>Note: There are no changes in the license requirements needed to access team-scoped insights in the Viva insights web app. This means that managers will continue to require a Viva Insights or a Microsoft 365 Copilot license.&nbsp;</li></ul><p> 2. Manage delegation controls</p><ul><li>If delegation is already in use by managers in your organization, existing delegates will automatically gain access to these new capabilities in the web app. Admins can manage delegation at the tenant or group level through the Microsoft 365 admin center.\n</li></ul><p>3. Turn on report publishing\n</p><ul><li>Admins can enable analysts to publish a broad set of Power BI reports from Advanced analysis directly to managers, giving them access to insights similar to those that exist in the Organizational behavior reports, and more! To do this, your organization must opt into the public preview for report publishing.\n</li></ul><p>4. Inform managers where to go\n</p><ul><li>A new, more powerful experience is coming.

      "Content": "<p>In response to customer feedback, we are introducing enhanced flexibility, greater scalability, and streamlined compliance management for private channels in Microsoft Teams.\n</p><p>Note: It is important for compliance managers to review and take appropriate action before migration starts for these changes to private channels. \n</p><p><b>What's changing?</b></p><p>Private channels will transition use a channel mailbox instead of individual user mailboxes. \n</p><p>Organizations with compliance policies (retention, legal hold, data loss prevention, or eDiscovery) for private channels must review these policies and must apply policies to the Microsoft 365 group for the channel’s team before migration begins to ensure continuity of the policy for a private channel.  Existing policies will continue to apply to user mailboxes; post-migration, new data will be governed by policies on the group. Note that policies applied to the team’s group can apply to all channels in the team.\n</p><p>After the transition to updated private channels in your organization, private channels will be updated as follows.\n</p><ol><li>Private channels are no longer limited to 30 per team. Instead, private channels can be added up to the limit of 1000 total channels per team.\n</li><li>Private channels can now have up to 5000 members, instead of 250.\n</li><li>Meetings can now be scheduled in private channels.\n</li><li>Compliance policies for private channels are part of the team’s group policies instead of the individual user level.\n</li></ol><p>The migration of private channels to the updated capabilities will begin in late September 2025 and continue through December 2025. During this period, private channels will continue to operate normally. Admins and compliance managers should complete any required policy changes by September 20, 2025, before the migration begins. Migration can start or end at different times for each tenant during the rollout period. To track progress, a new PowerShell command will be available for tenants to check whether their migration has started or is completed. This post will be updated soon with details on the PowerShell command.\n</p><p><b>When this will happen:</b>\n</p><p>General Availability (Worldwide): We will begin rolling out late September 2025 and expect to complete by mid-December 2025.\n</p><p><b>Action required by compliance managers and admins</b></p><ol><li>Purview eDiscovery and Legal Hold</li>\n<p></p><p>With this change, private channel data will move from user mailboxes to the group mailbox, aligning with how shared channels data is stored. Previously, legal holds were applied to user mailboxes since private channel data resided in each member’s mailbox. Post-migration, the latest version of private channel message data from each user’s mailbox is moved to the private channel’s group mailbox. Message edits and deleted messages will not be copied into the group mailbox.\n</p><p>Note: For users on hold, copies of message edits and deleted messages will remain in the user’s preserved library folder until the hold expires, while the latest version of private channel message data from each user’s mailbox is copied to the private channel’s group mailbox. \n</p><p>Before migration\n</p><p>If a legal hold exists for a private channel, admins must also apply the policy to the team’s group, in addition to the policy already applied to users’ mailboxes, in order for a hold to apply to new data generated and stored in the private channel’s mailbox. Note that policies applied to the team’s group can apply to all channels in the team.\n</p><p><img src=\"https://cxcs.microsoft.net/file/ccp/en-us/752d2d97-48d7-4491-a3e7-ecc866373a44  \" width=\"400\" height=\"\"></p><p>Screenshot 1: Setting up a new hold in Microsoft Purview compliance portal.\n</p><p>After migration\n</p><p>For existing holds admins will need to ensure that the hold is applied to the user mailbox as well as the new group mailbox, in order for a hold to apply to existing and new message data. Any new legal holds will need to be applied to the group.\n</p><p>For complete eDiscovery, include both the private channel’s users’ mailboxes and the team’s group mailbox to retrieve pre-migration messages, message history, and post-migration new content.\n</p><p><img src=\"https://cxcs.microsoft.net/file/ccp/en-us/0de1f667-c352-400b-8a94-57237676a30d  \" width=\"400\" height=\"\"></p><p>Screenshot 2: Configuring an eDiscovery search in Microsoft Purview compliance portal.\n</p><li>Purview Data Loss Prevention (DLP)</li> \n<p></p><p>With this change, private channel messages will be included as a part of the DLP policy scoped to the private channel’s team’s group, as opposed to the user mailbox. \n</p><p>Before migration\n</p><p>Admins must modify the “Teams chat and channel messages” policy for private channels to add the team’s group containing the private channel, in addition to the user mailbox, in order to include new private channel messages in a policy. Note that policies applied to the team’s group can apply to all channels in the team.\n</p><p>After migration\n</p><p>Ensure that “Teams chat and channel messages” policy for private channels is scoped to the team’s group containing the private channel. \n</p><p><img src=\"https://cxcs.microsoft.net/file/ccp/en-us/96d2a6b8-fdf0-402c-8475-d8631fe4ae2b \" width=\"400\" height=\"\"></p><p>Screenshot 3: Configuring a data loss prevention policy in Microsoft Purview compliance portal.\n</p><li>Purview Retention Policy</li>\n<p></p><p>After this change, creation of new private channel-specific policies will not be possible in the Purview portal. Instead, “Teams channel messages” policies applied to the team’s group will now include private channels. Existing private channel policies will remain in effect and preserve all held message data in user mailboxes. Editing of existing policies will not be supported but policies can be removed.\n</p><p>Before migration\n</p><p>Apply current private channel retention policies (previously on user mailboxes) to Teams channel messages to include the team’s group, in order to include new private channel messages in a policy. In Microsoft Purview compliance portal, go to solutions &gt; Data Lifecycle Management &gt; Retention policies. Note that policies applied to the team’s group can apply to all channels in the team. \n</p><p>After migration\n</p><p>If the parent team’s group retention policy differs from the private channel’s policy, create a new or equivalent policy to ensure consistent retention.</p><p> \n</p><p><img src=\"https://cxcs.microsoft.net/file/ccp/en-us/c565bdcb-1dbc-4f94-b060-b5bbc96d368a \" width=\"400\" height=\"\"></p><p>Screenshot 4: Configuring “Teams channel messages” for a retention policy in Microsoft Purview compliance portal.\n</p></ol><p>Frequently asked questions\n</p><ol><li>How can admins identify a user’s private channel memberships?\n<ul><li>Use Teams Admin Center under team settings, or run PowerShell: Get-TeamChannelUser to list members.\n</li></ul></li><li>When is compliance manager action required?\n<ul><li>If a policy (legal hold, eDiscovery, retention, DLP) applied to a user’s mailbox, in order to include private channel messages, differs from the team policies for the team hosting the private channel. Policies must be applied to the team’s group in order to include new private channel messages in a policy. Note that policies applied to the team’s group can apply to all channels in the team.</li><li>During eDiscovery for users on hold or during migration, search both user mailbox and group mailbox for complete data on a private channel.</li></ul></li><li>What if no action is taken?\n<ul><li>User-level policies will not apply to a private channel’s new message data. Team-level policies will apply to private channels. \n</li></ul></li><li>Why isn’t Microsoft automatically applying policies from user mailboxes to a private channel’s team?\n<ul><li>Tenant admins and compliance managers must assess and apply policies as needed. Group policies apply to all channels in the Team. Some user mailbox policies are intended for all of a user’s messages, and some are intended for private channel messages. Each organization must review and decide on policies.\n</li></ul></li><li>Is there any impact to end users?\n<ul><li>During migration, users may see duplicate search results in Teams searches—both links will navigate to the same content in Microsoft Teams.\n</li></ul></li></ol><p>Please refer to this blog post for more information: <a href=\"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/microsoftteamsblog/unlocking-the-full-potential-of-private-channels-in-microsoft-teams/4438767\" target=\"_blank\">New enhancements in Private Channels in Microsoft Teams unlock their full potential</a>&nbsp;</p><p>We appreciate your attention to this important update.\n</p>",

Please consider this tradeoff in your adoption strategy.</p><p>If your organization has governance tools for SharePoint Communication sites that work effectively in a reactive manner (i.e., governance is applied after the site is created), Microsoft recommends extending this process to include Loop workspaces rather than using this policy.</p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b>\n</p><p>There is nothing you need to do to prepare. This capability will roll to your tenant automatically.</p>",

Thank you for your patience.</p><p>As outlined in MC677236 (July 2024), Azure to OneDrive migration of existing Whiteboards has now started and will reach your tenant (if you haven’t received it already) in the coming months, before June 2025. Complete details can be found in this support article: <a href=\"https://support.microsoft.com/office/migration-of-whiteboards-from-azure-to-onedrive-6ddc6df1-540e-4b70-8e6a-541fafdc24f4\" target=\"_blank\">Migration of Whiteboards from Azure to OneDrive - Microsoft Support</a>.\n</p><p><i>Action for admins</i>: The migration affects only Microsoft Azure-based Whiteboards. If your tenant does not have any Azure Whiteboards, this migration does not impact you. Check if your tenant has Azure Whiteboards using this PowerShell cmdlet: <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/module/whiteboard/get-whiteboardsfortenant?view=whiteboard-ps\" target=\"_blank\">- Get-WhiteboardsForTenant</a>\n</p><p><i>Action item for users:</i> Until the migration completes. When your tenant receives the migration code, users can trigger a migration by starting a Whiteboard session from a web browser by simply going to <a href=\"https://whiteboard.microsoft.com/\" target=\"_blank\">https://whiteboard.microsoft.com/</a> or by using a Whiteboard in their Teams meetings.</p><p>Whiteboard previously stored whiteboard files in Azure storage. In 2022, Whiteboard switched to OneDrive as the storage location for most newly created boards. We made a client-based migration available for your organization, which is currently rolling out gradually.&nbsp;</p><p>This message is associated with Microsoft 365 Roadmap ID <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?filters=&amp;searchterms=117394%2C\" target=\"_blank\">117394</a>.\n</p><p><b>When this will happen</b>\n</p><p>The client-based migration experience started in December 2024 (previously July), and we expect to complete the migration by late August 2025 (previously early August).</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization</b>\n</p><p>Any user who launches an eligible Whiteboard client (Whiteboard on Windows, Whiteboard in Teams desktop/web) will automatically kick off a non-blocking migration of all their whiteboards. Depending on how many whiteboards they have, on average the process will take between a few seconds to a few minutes.\n</p><p>The migration will provide many benefits for your organization and users on the migrated boards, including:\n</p><ul><li>Features unique to whiteboards stored in OneDrive, such as Follow, Commenting, and more.\n</li><li>Improved performance on whiteboards now stored in OneDrive.\n</li><li>Improved compliance and security associated with whiteboard being stored in OneDrive.\n</li></ul><p>There is no possibility to delay the migration.\n</p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare</b>\n</p><p>The migration will happen naturally and automatically for most users in your organization with no disruption, but please ensure that users are aware they need to launch Whiteboard in one of the previously mentioned clients in order to keep their content prior to the conclusion of the migration.\n</p><p>In the unlikely case that a user’s whiteboards fail to migrate, they will see an error banner. We will attempt to migrate the board again in 30 days. If the board contains important information, we recommend the user copy the content to a new whiteboard.\n</p><p>Users will be able to see which boards have not migrated in a dedicated section on the board picker. Admins will be able to verify what whiteboard content remains in Azure and obtain the userIDs via our PowerShell cmdlets, if you wish to proactively notify users to get their content.\n</p><p>Complete details about the migration can be found in <a href=\"https://support.microsoft.com/office/migration-of-whiteboards-from-azure-to-onedrive-6ddc6df1-540e-4b70-8e6a-541fafdc24f4\" target=\"_blank\">Migration of Whiteboards from Azure to OneDrive - Microsoft Support</a>, including how start and completion of migration will be notified, how errors will be communicated, and the new PowerShell cmdlets.</p>",

Thank you for your patience.</p><p><b>Introduction</b></p><p>We’re introducing Multi-Geo In-Region Routing (IRR) for Exchange Online, a new capability that helps organizations meet regional data residency requirements by allowing inbound email routing to be aligned with user locations. With IRR, admins can configure accepted domains to route messages directly to a designated geo-region, ensuring that email data is processed and stored entirely within the recipient’s region—even if it differs from the tenant’s primary location. This helps organizations meet compliance requirements without compromising email delivery performance.</p><p>This message is associated with Microsoft 365 Roadmap ID <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?filters=&amp;searchterms=410245\" target=\"_blank\">410245</a>.</p><p><b>When this will happen:</b></p><p>Public Preview: We will begin rolling out in early October 2025 and expect to complete by end of October 2025.\n</p><p>General Availability (Worldwide): We expect to begin rolling out in early December 2025 and expect to complete by late December 2025.</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b></p><p>In-Region Routing (IRR) is disabled by default. If you do not plan to use this feature, no action is required.</p><p>For domains where you choose to enable IRR, the feature allows you to route inbound emails to accepted domains associated with specific geo-regions. When these domains are aligned with users located in the same geo-region, emails are fully processed and stored within the recipient’s region. This ensures that data remains within the user’s Preferred Data Location (PDL), supporting stronger data sovereignty and compliance with regional regulations.</p><p>If your organization uses Microsoft Purview capabilities such as Data Loss Prevention (DLP), retention policies, or eDiscovery, you may need to review and adjust those policies to ensure they align with the new regional routing behavior.</p><p></p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b></p><ul><li>Ensure that admins have the necessary permissions to manage accepted domains and access to either Exchange Online PowerShell or to the Microsoft 365 admin center.</li><li>Review your domain configurations and identify users located in secondary geo-regions.\n</li><li>Prepare to configure accepted domains with the new geo-region property.</li><li>Review the licensing terms, as Multi-Geo licenses will be indefinitely required to use In-Region Routing:<ul><li><a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/enterprise/microsoft-365-multi-geo?view=o365-worldwide#licensing\" target=\"_blank\">https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/enterprise/microsoft-365-multi-geo?view=o365-worldwide#licensing</a></li><li><a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/enterprise/microsoft-365-multi-geo?view=o365-worldwide#getting-started\" target=\"_blank\">https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/enterprise/microsoft-365-multi-geo?view=o365-worldwide#getting-started</a>&nbsp;</li></ul></li><li>Review the documentation for configuring the feature: <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/enterprise/multi-geo-region-routing?view=o365-worldwide\" target=\"_blank\">Configure Multi-Geo In-Region Routing (In Preview) - Microsoft 365 Enterprise | Microsoft Learn\"</a></li></ul><p>We value your feedback and want to hear from you if you have any questions or concerns. Please comment or contact us through the M365 Admin Center if you need any assistance.</p><p><b>Compliance considerations:</b></p><ul><li>Does the change alter how existing user data is processed, stored, or accessed? - Yes. Emails are stored in-region based on domain configuration.</li><li>Does the change modify, interrupt, or disable any Purview capabilities? - Maybe. Depends on how DLP or retention policies are scoped by region.</li><li>Does the change alter how admins can monitor, report on, or demonstrate compliance activities? - Maybe.

Thank you for your patience.\n</p><p>Microsoft Fabric will introduce two Preview features called Workspace-level private links and <i>Outbound access protection </i>at the Fabric workspace level. At the tenant level, the corresponding settings <i>Configure workspace level inbound network rules</i> and <i>Configure workspace level outbound network rules</i> will be in the Advanced networking section of the Fabric admin portal.The new tenant-level settings will be disabled by default. You (the tenant admin) can switch ON the tenant toggle in the Fabric admin center if you decide to make this feature available to your workspace admins. This will allow the workspace admins to configure Workspace-level private links and Outbound access protection. The workspace admin will then decide whether to configure these features at the workspace level.&nbsp;</p><p><b>When this will happen:</b>\n</p><p>Public Preview (Worldwide): We will begin rolling out in late August 2025 (previously late July).</p><p>We will communicate the plan for General Availability in a future post.\n</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b>\n</p><p><i>Feature 1: Workspace-level private links</i>\n</p><ul><li>Private links provide secure inbound connectivity to Microsoft Fabric.

During Preview, admins can block inbound public access with the public REST API, which does not require a workspace-level private link set up in Azure. The corresponding-level tenant admin setting <i>Configure workspace level inbound network rules</i> will be available in the Fabric admin portal at <i>Tenant settings &gt; Advanced networking:</i>\n</li></ul><p></p><p><img src=\"https://cxcs.microsoft.net/file/ccp/en-us/3b49f2b6-47af-4042-895e-bbb33dca04ba\" style=\"width: 400px;\" alt=\"admin controls\">\n</p><p><i>Feature 2:</i> Outbound access protection<i> at the user workspace level</i></p><ul><li>Data exfiltration is a concern for many enterprises that store sensitive data in the cloud. When used with other networking features in Fabric, the <i>Outbound access protection</i> feature can help secure your data from exfiltration.  Workspace admins will be able to block all the outbound connectivity from the workspace. Once enabled, all outbound connections made by Fabric Spark artifacts from this workspace will be blocked. The only way to enable a connection is by first establishing a managed private endpoint (MPE) from the workspace to the destination. Workspace admins can control this feature in <i>Workspace settings &gt; Network security &gt; Outbound access protection &gt; </i>Switch on the toggle for <i>Block outbound public access:\n</i></li></ul><p><img src=\"https://cxcs.microsoft.net/file/ccp/en-us/4eeb53ca-0821-44b0-a4ee-248ff3830a0b\" style=\"width: 400px;\" alt=\"admin controls\">\n</p><ul><li>In this Preview, we will support OneLake and these Fabric items: Lakehouse, Notebook, Environment, and Spark Job Definition.

Thank you for your patience.</p><p style=\"\">Today, users can see Outlook contacts created with their Entra ID (AAD) account in Teams, but contacts created in Teams are not available in Outlook. To provide a consistent experience we are making changes to allow Teams contacts, created with a user's&nbsp;Entra ID (AAD) account, to be visible in Outlook as well.</p><p style=\"\"><b>Upcoming changes to contacts in Teams and Outlook:</b></p><p>Currently, Teams and Outlook maintain separate contact lists for enterprise users. Based on your feedback, we plan to introduce a unified contact experience, ensuring a consistent contacts experience across Outlook and Teams. In future, changes to contacts in users’ organization (Entra ID) account in Teams will reflect in Outlook and vice versa.&nbsp;</p><p>What's Happened so far:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>We have completed one round of migration of all Teams contacts to Outlook in January 2024.&nbsp;</li><li>As a result, users may see more contacts in Outlook, namely those created in Teams and potentially Skype for Business contacts (if enabled).&nbsp;</li><li>Existing Outlook contacts may also be enriched with additional details from corresponding Teams contacts.&nbsp;</li><li>Teams users can see Outlook contacts but cannot edit them inside Teams.&nbsp;</li></ul><p><b>What's Coming:</b>&nbsp;</p><p>Users will gradually upgrade to the new unified experience from December 2024. The new experience will be enabled for each user across all endpoints (Desktop, Mobile, Devices etc.) simultaneously. Once the new experience is enabled for a user, they will see same set of contacts in Outlook and Teams. Any change in Outlook will reflect in Teams and vice versa.&nbsp;</p><p>All Teams contact changes (creations and edits) made since January will be included in the unified store. During creations, a small set of users may see duplicate contacts in the unified store. To help users navigate the transition, category label ‘Teams Conflict’ will be applied to duplicate contacts. This label will help users see any conflicts (duplicates or inconsistencies) that need their attention.&nbsp;</p><p> <b>When this will happen:</b></p><p>This activity is expected to be completed for all active users by August 2025 tentatively (previously June). Once this activity is complete, users will work with a single contact list across Teams and Outlook.&nbsp;</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization</b><br></p><p>Once this change is complete, users will be able to see created contacts across both Outlook and Teams and vice versa.<br></p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare</b></p><p>Action Required: Update your organisation documentation and training materials to reflect the upcoming changes for the new unified contact experience.</p><p>You may consider updating your training and documentation as appropriate. If users wish to retain a snapshot of their existing contacts in Outlook, please encourage users to back-up their existing contacts using the export capability in Outlook.</p><p><br></p>",

Whether you're scheduling messages, managing approvals, syncing updates across apps, or triggering actions from chat messages, Workflows makes it easy to build automations in just a few clicks. It’s powered by Power Automate and designed to help you stay focused on what matters most.</p><p>This new version addresses previous concerns around complexity and performance, delivering a faster, more intuitive, and streamlined interface. With the updated experience, users can now create powerful automations in three steps or fewer.</p><p>This release is part of our broader effort to make automation more accessible and impactful for every information worker. Whether you're new to automation or a seasoned pro, the new Workflows app is designed to meet you where you work—and help you get more done with less effort.

This reduces the chances of data disparity between different tools and allows security teams to conduct investigations with better accuracy.\n</li><li><i>Enhances the data pipeline for Advanced Hunting, resulting in improved performance and accuracy</i>: The migration will optimize data ingestion pipeline and proactive monitoring system of Advanced Hunting. This will lead to improved data freshness and reduce the chances of potential data quality issues in data pipeline.\n</li><li><i>Accelerates development cycles for new features built on the new data platform: </i>The modernized data architecture will enable faster iteration and deployment of new features. By reducing dependencies on legacy systems and adopting a scalable infrastructure, Microsoft can introduce feature enhancements more rapidly, bringing greater value to security analysts.\n</li><li><i>Strengthens proactive monitoring capabilities to minimize potential impact on customer workflows:</i> The new platform will enhance real-time monitoring and alerting mechanisms, allowing for proactive detection and resolution of issues before they impact user workflows. Improved observability will ensure that any latency or disruptions are identified early, reducing downtime and improving system reliability.</li></ul><p><i>Potential impact</i></p><ul><li>No direct impact on customer data.\n</li><li>While the new platform brings significant improvements, users may experience slight delays in data availability (such as email metadata and post-delivery actions like quarantine release and manual remediation) in certain experiences, including Threat Explorer, Email Entity, and the Email Summary Panel.\n</li><li>In some cases, users may encounter intermittent failures for brief moment when loading the Email Summary Panel from experiences such as Quarantine and Submission immediately after an email is delivered. However, this will automatically resolve once the necessary data has been processed and stored.</li></ul><p><i>Resolution plan</i></p><p>While our team works on the migration, we are also actively working on optimizing the performance of the new data platform to align as closely as possible with the data freshness rate of Threat Explorer before the data platform migration. Also, efforts are underway to minimize failure rates across user experiences caused by temporary data unavailability.\n</p><p>The phase 1 performance improvement work was completed in late June 2025. After that, our teams are continuously monitoring the latencies and investing in further improvements to ensure seamless security operations experience to end users.</p><p>Phase 2 of the performance improvement plan is targeted to further improve the data freshness rate and is expected to complete by end of December 2025.</p><p>This change will be available by default.</p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b></p><p>This migration will happen automatically by the specified dates with no admin action required before the rollout.

However, be aware that anyone with access to the identity can assume it.</p><p>To access this change:\n</p><ol><li>Navigate to the Fabric Workspace where you want to add RBAC role.\n</li><li>Select <i>Manage Access</i>.\n</li><li>Select <i>Add people or groups</i>.\n</li><li>Enter the name of the Workspace identity (same as Workspace Name).\n</li><li>Assign roles as appropriate.\n</li></ol><p><b>NOTE:</b> After this rollout, admins can still add Workspace identity service principles to any workspace RBAC role if needed. Consider the implications if you plan on doing so, as any individual given access to the identity—example through workspace roles such as member or contributor—is allowed to assume the identity.

Thank you for your patience.\n</p><p>Coming soon for Microsoft Purview: We are announcing the public preview of the integration of Adaptive protection with Data Lifecycle Management (DLM) to help you find the right balance to protect against data sabotage while enabling productivity. This new integration leverages DLM features to provide an additional control for Adaptive protection that automatically preserves items deleted by a user with an elevated risk level, so items can be restored if needed.</p><p>This message is associated with Microsoft 365 Roadmap ID <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?filters=&amp;searchterms=392839\" target=\"_blank\">392839</a>.\n</p><p><b>When this will happen:</b>\n</p><p>Public preview: We will begin rolling out in late June 2024 (previously early May) and expect to complete by late July 2024 (previously mid-July).\n</p><p>General Availability:&nbsp; We will begin rolling out early February 2026 and expect to complete by late February 2026.</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b>\n</p><p>After the rollout, and after you enable Adaptive protection for your tenant, the retention label and auto-apply policy for data lifecycle management will be automatically created for you. This policy will automatically include elevated risk users identified by Microsoft Purview | Insider Risk Management solution. If these users delete content from Microsoft SharePoint, Microsoft OneDrive, or Microsoft Exchange, a retention label is automatically applied to that content to retain it for 120 days. Retention labels are automatically applied to unlabeled content deleted by these users. When these users are no longer at the elevated risk level, they are automatically removed from the DLM policy, and the system will no longer keep a copy of content they delete. Any content copies previously retained when the user had an elevated risk level will be kept for the 120 days as specified by the retention label.\n</p><p>Unlike other retention labeling scenarios, users do not see the retention label, and you do not need to create or manage the retention label or policy. At this time, you can't change the retention period or assign different policies based on the different risk levels, or for different locations. The single retention label and auto-labeling policy for your tenant is not visible in the Microsoft Purview compliance portal.</p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b>\n</p><p>Learn more: <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/purview/retention#dynamically-mitigate-the-risk-of-accidental-or-malicious-deletes\" target=\"_blank\">Learn about retention policies &amp; labels to retain or delete | Microsoft Learn</a>\n</p><p>If you're using Adaptive protection and want to automatically retain content deleted by elevated risk users, follow these steps to turn on this new integration.\n</p><ol><li>Sign in to the <a href=\"https://compliance.microsoft.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Microsoft Purview compliance portal</a>.\n</li><li>Navigate to <i>Data lifecycle management &gt; Microsoft 365 &gt; Adaptive protection settings</i> in the top right corner.\n</li><li>Turn the setting ON and select <i>Save</i>.\n</li></ol><p>\n</p><p><img src=\"https://cxcs.microsoft.net/file/messagecenter/en-us/fe6a20ed-77ce-44ce-b862-bc7f4b78b93e\" style=\"width: 400px;\" alt=\"admin settings\">\n</p><p><img src=\"https://cxcs.microsoft.net/file/messagecenter/en-us/521b359c-13a9-41ef-ad96-215789a32eb3\" style=\"width: 400px;\" alt=\"admin settings\">\n</p><p>If you’re not using Adaptive protection already, turn on Adaptive protection and the new feature will be enabled along with Adaptive protection.\n</p><p>This rollout will happen automatically by the specified date with no admin action required before the rollout.

Thank you for your patience.</p><p>As part of the Microsoft Secure Future Initiative (SFI) and in alignment with the “Secure by Default” principle, we are updating default settings in Microsoft 365 to help you meet the minimum security benchmark and harden your tenant’s security posture. These changes target legacy authentication protocols and app access permissions that may expose organizations to unnecessary risk.\n</p><p>This is the first step in a broader effort to evaluate and evolve Microsoft 365 defaults through the lens of security best practices.\n</p><p><b>When this will happen:</b></p><p>These changes will begin rolling out in mid-July 2025 and are expected to complete by August 2025.\n</p><p><b>How this affects your organization</b></p><p>The following settings will be updated:</p><table class=\"table table-bordered\"><tbody><tr><td>Settings</td><td>Impact</td></tr><tr><td>Block legacy browser authentication to SharePoint and OneDrive using RPS (Relying Party Suite)</td><td>Legacy authentication protocols like RPS (Relying Party Suite) are vulnerable to brute-force and phishing attacks due to non-modern authentication. Blocking this prevents applications that are using outdated methods from accessing SharePoint and OneDrive via browser. To use PowerShell to block legacy browser authentication, see <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.online.sharepoint.powershell/set-spotenant?view=sharepoint-ps#-legacybrowserauthprotocolsenabled\" target=\"_blank\">Set-SPOTenant</a>.</td></tr><tr><td>Block FPRPC (FrontPage Remote Procedure Call) protocol for Office file opens</td><td>FrontPage Remote Procedure Call (FPRPC) is a legacy protocol used for remote web page authoring. While no longer widely used, Legacy protocols such as FPRPC can be more susceptible to compromise and blocking FPRPC helps reduce exposure to vulnerabilities. With this change, FPRPC will be blocked for opening files, preventing the use of this non-modern protocol in Microsoft 365 clients. To learn how to block the FPRPC protocol, see <a href=\"https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2324509\" target=\"_blank\">turn on web content filtering</a>.</td></tr><tr><td>Require admin consent for third-party apps accessing files and sites</td><td><p>Users allowing third-party apps to access file and site content can lead to overexposure of an organization’s content. Requiring admins to consent to this access can help reduce overexposure. With this change,  Microsoft managed <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/enterprise-apps/manage-app-consent-policies\" target=\"_blank\">App Consent Policies</a> will be enabled, and users will be unable to consent to third party applications accessing their files and sites by default. Instead, they can request administrators to consent on their behalf. To configure admin consent, follow instructions here: <a href=\"https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2324703\" target=\"_blank\">Configuring the Admin Consent workflow</a>. Customers who have already blocked user consent, turned on our previously recommended consent settings, or applied custom user consent settings will not be affected by this change.<br>Admins can also configure granular app access policies, such as limiting user access to the application for specific users or groups. Learn more <a href=\"https://aka.ms/entra-app-access\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.<br></p></td></tr></tbody></table><p>These changes are on by default and apply to all Microsoft 365 tenants. No additional licensing is required.\n</p><p><b>What you can do to prepare:</b></p><p>We recommend the following actions:\n</p><ul><li><b>Assess current configurations:</b> As applicable, identify current configurations for <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/sharepoint-online/set-spotenant?view=sharepoint-ps#-legacybrowserauthprotocolsenabled\" target=\"_blank\">RPS </a>or <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/module/sharepoint-online/set-spotenant?view=sharepoint-ps\" target=\"_blank\">FPRPC</a> protocols.</li><li><b>Notify stakeholders: </b>Inform IT admins, app owners, and security teams about the upcoming changes.\n</li><li><b>Update documentation: </b>Ensure internal guidance reflects the new defaults and admin consent process.\n</li><li><b>Configure Admin Consent workflow:</b> If third party apps access is applicable for your organization, learn how to set up the workflow: <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/enterprise-apps/configure-admin-consent-workflow\" target=\"_blank\">Configuring admin consent workflow.</a></li></ul><p>Additional considerations\n</p><ul><li>Does the change alter how existing customer data is processed, stored, or accessed?

The system can perform this task for an app after a device reboot and periodically as system conditions allow.</p><p><b>When this will happen:</b></p><p>General Availability (Worldwide, GCC, GCC High, DoD): We will begin rolling out late June 2025 (previously late May) and expect to complete by late September 2025 (previously late July).</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b></p><p>New tasks will be publicly visible in the Windows Task Scheduler.&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Task Names: Office Startup Boost and Office Startup Boost Logon.</li><li>Task Description: This task ensures that Office applications can take advantage of preloading performance enhancements.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>Initial roll-out will be on Microsoft Word. We have no announcements to make at this time regarding support for additional applications.</p><p>Startup Boost is only available when your PC has enough resources to run without impacting system performance. This includes having at least 8 GB of available RAM, and at least 5 GB of available disk space. When Startup Boost is active, the scheduled task will not run immediately at login to avoid slowing down your PC — it will wait 10 minutes to ensure the system is in a steady idle state. Additionally, Startup Boost will be disabled when Energy Saver mode is active. Startup Boost only runs if you have launched Word recently, and if you have not launched Word recently it will automatically disable itself.</p><p>Startup Boost is an optional performance feature. It is safe to disable. When disabled, Microsoft Office applications will be fully functional but may take longer to load. Customers can disable Startup Boost entirely by preventing the process from starting. To disable the feature, use the in-app setting, e.g., <i>Word &gt; Options &gt; General &gt; Startup Boost (under Start up Options)</i>.</p><p>Scheduled task entry in Task Scheduler:</p><p><img src=\"https://cxcs.microsoft.net/file/ccp/en-us/da011aba-1d94-42a5-8bb7-507075d26620\" style=\"width: 450px;\"></p><p><br></p><p>End-user UI to enable/disable Startup Boost in Word:</p><p><img src=\"https://cxcs.microsoft.net/file/ccp/en-us/e038abb2-c032-48ed-a891-5bfcba1bad8e\" style=\"width: 450px;\"><br></p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b></p><p>This rollout will happen automatically with no admin action required.&nbsp;</p><p>You can disable this Startup Boost task like any other scheduled task.

For example, if an organizer marks a meeting as highly confidential and turns on AI-generated notes, those notes will not be marked as highly confidential. The suggested workaround is to not use Facilitator in meetings where sensitive information will be discussed. This limitation will be documented in admin and end user documentation at release.

Thank you for your patience.</p><p>Microsoft Purview Insider Risk Management (IRM) will be adding a new role--Data Security Investigation Contributor--to the Insider Risk Management Investigators role group. This will allow members of the Insider Risk Management Investigators role group to launch   a Data Security Investigation (DSI) from an IRM case. \n</p><p>DSI is a new AI-powered solution that enables data security teams to identify incident-related data, conduct deep content analysis, and mitigate risk within one unified solution. DSI enables data security admins to efficiently identify incident-relevant content by searching their Microsoft 365 data estate to locate emails, Teams messages, Copilot prompts and responses, and documents. Once the investigation is scoped, DSI’s generative AI capabilities allow admins to gain deeper insights into the impacted data, revealing critical security risks and sensitive information. Investigative capabilities include the ability to categorize evidence, perform vector searches, and examine impacted data for security and sensitive data risks. DSI visualizes correlations between investigation data, users, and their activities. To mitigate identified risks, DSI facilitates secure collaboration between partner teams. Post-investigation learnings can be used to refine existing policies to strengthen an organization's security practices.  \n</p><p>The integration between IRM and DSI allows an IRM investigator to identify when a risky user needs deeper investigation to launch a pre-scoped investigation directly from the user activity pane, allowing them to view content analysis related to that user and better assess post-incident data impact.  \n</p><p>This message is associated with roadmap ID  <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?rtc=1%26filters%3D&amp;searchterms=485707\" target=\"_blank\">485707</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>\n</p><p><b>When this will happen:</b>\n</p><p>Public Preview (Worldwide): We will begin rolling out early April 2025 and expect to complete by late April 2025.</p><p>General Availability (Worldwide): We will begin rolling out in mid-July 2025 (previously mid-June) and expect to complete by mid-August 2025 (previously mid-July).</p><p> \n</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b> \n</p><p>With this update, members of the Insider Risk Management Investigators role group will be able to create Data Security Investigations from an Insider Risk Management case.

These exempted senders will only be able to send emails exhibiting multiple From addresses without a Sender address header to recipients belonging to the same tenant as the sender. We will provide a subsequent update by the end of May 2025 (previously end of March) with an updated timeline for tenants that are opted out.</p><p>We're going to start gradually dropping messages that have multiple From addresses (also known as P2 From headers) without a Sender header from being processed via Exchange Online, please review the section \"When this will happen\" for rollout timeline information for your tenant.</p><p>If we see significant traffic exhibiting multiple From addresses (P2 From headers) without a Sender header in your tenant in the month of September, we will send you a Message Center Post by October 15th alerting you and providing some sample message IDs.</p><p>We are doing this to comply with <a href=\"https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5322#section-3.6.2\" target=\"_blank\">RFC 5322 (https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5322#section-3.6.2)</a>&nbsp;which mandates the Sender header to be present and contain a single address if the From header has more than one address.

On October 15, we sent a targeted MC post to customers showing high volumes of messages exhibiting multiple P2 From Addresses without a Sender Address as they may be impacted by this change.\n</p><p>For investigating if you will be impacted by this change, focus your investigation on messages sent using On Premises Inbound Connectors to Exchange Online. Authenticated mail submission is not impacted because submitting messages like this using those submissions are not allowed (Graph, Outlook clients, SMTP AUTH Client Submission).</p><p><b>How this affects your organization:</b>\n</p><p>If email clients including devices and applications that you use to send messages, do so using multiple From addresses but without a Sender address header after the change starts rolling out to your environment, you will get an NDR error code 550 5.1.20 “Multiple From addresses are not allowed without Sender address.</p><p><b>What you can do to prepare:</b>\n</p><p>When this change is in effect, if you need to send a message that has more than one email address in the From field, make sure that you have a single email address in the Sender header.\n</p><p>If you expect this change to cause any issues for your organization, please share that feedback.\n</p>",

To help protect sensitive content and support compliance with data handling policies, copying text from live captions is now disabled by default. This ensures captions remain a real-time experience, reducing the risk of content being copied and shared out of context.\n</p><p>Second, the <i>Live transcript</i> panel will no longer open automatically for the user who starts recording, which also triggers transcription in the background. Before this rollout, this panel only auto-opens for the person who initiates recording or transcription — not for other participants — but this can be distracting and isn’t always relevant to the user's intent. After this rollout, the <i>Live transcript</i> panel will remain closed unless manually opened or the user explicitly starts transcription. This gives users more control over their meeting layout and helps avoid unnecessary screen changes during important discussions.\n</p><p>Third, when transcription is enabled, users who attempt to open the<i> Live transcript</i> panel will now see a banner suggesting they switch to live captions instead.

Please refer to this new post going forward:</p><p>Coming soon: Eligible users will be prompted in the Message Bar below the toolbar in Microsoft Word, Microsoft Excel, and Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows desktops to enroll in <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/sharepoint/redirect-known-folders\" target=\"_blank\">OneDrive Known Folder Move (KFM).</a> Users will be able to select the folders to back up in Microsoft OneDrive.\n</p><p><b>When this will happen:</b></p><p>Public Preview: We will begin rolling out mid-April 2025 and expect to complete by late April 2025. \n</p><p>General Availability (Worldwide): We will begin rolling out mid-May 2025 (previously early May) and expect to complete by late July 2025 (previously mid-June).</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b>\n</p><p>If your organization still has users who are not enrolled in KFM, the message \"BACK UP THIS DOCUMENT: Share and work with others in this and other files using OneDrive\" will encourage them to do it while using familiar desktop apps. After users select the Open OneDrive button, they can select the folders they want to back up in OneDrive:\n</p><p><img src=\"https://cxcs.microsoft.net/file/ccp/en-us/ca81daa5-b315-416d-966e-bed4ff8723ea\" style=\"width: 400px;\" alt=\"user message\">\n</p><p>When users are enrolled in KFM, the files in their enrolled folder benefit from the advantages of cloud files:\n</p><ul><li>Increased security and compliance: Enterprises can increase security and compliance, because all cloud files are subject to default classification, labeling, and protection (CLP) policies and auto-labeling. \n</li><li>Copilot support: Files are Copilot-enabled, making it simple and intuitive to access and leverage Copilot. (A Microsoft 365 Copilot license or a Microsoft 365 license is required to use Copilot.)</li><li>Easy collaboration: Cloud files enable sharing, commenting, and easy collaboration, with AutoSave ensuring changes are frequently and consistently saved. \n</li><li>Access from anywhere: Cloud files can be accessed from Windows, Mac, the web, iOS, and Android with synchronized changes. \n</li><li>Backup: Protection from data loss due to device failure. \n</li><li>Access to cloud-specific features like AutoSave and Version History</li></ul><p>After enrolling, users can access their files in the known folders in File Explorer or OneDrive. \n</p><p>No action required. The feature will be enabled automatically for eligible users. If KFM is blocked in your organization, the message will not be displayed. \n</p><p>If an organization has blocked KFM, we will honor that and not display the message to the organization's users.\n</p><p>This Message Bar will not appear if:\n</p><ul><li>The user is already enrolled in KFM\n</li><li>The user doesn’t have OneDrive provisioned, installed, and running\n</li><li>The existing policy to block KFM Wizard (<a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/sharepoint/use-group-policy#prevent-users-from-moving-their-windows-known-folders-to-onedrive\" target=\"_blank\">Prevent users from moving their Windows known folders to OneDrive</a>) is enabled and deployed\n</li><li>The new policy <i>Restrict KFM from Office</i> is enabled and deployed\n</li></ul><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b></p><p>This rollout will happen automatically by the specified date with no admin action required before the rollout. Review your current configuration and notify users about the change, explaining the benefits of OneDrive and the sync process. Consider updating any relevant documentation.\n</p><p>Based on your feedback, we created a new policy called <i>Restrict KFM from Office. </i>When this new policy is enabled and deployed, Office apps won’t show the Message Bar regardless of user eligibility. This policy is scoped only to Office apps and does not affect other OneDrive or KFM settings.

Group policy can represent policy settings in the file system or in Active Directory Domain Services.

Thank you for your patience.</p><p style=\"margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:7.5pt;margin-left:0in\"><b>Important update regarding the cloud hosted Mailbox External Recipient Rate Limit:</b>  In order to reduce the impact on customers, Microsoft has again decided to delay the rollout of the cloud hosted Mailbox External Recipient Rate Limit (MERRL) by ~six months. The MERRL will go into enforcement in April 2026 for trial tenants and new tenants if the tenant is provisioned on/after April 1st, 2026. In April 2026, the Exchange Admin Center Report will be available for tenant admins to review Sender mailbox data on external recipient volume. In October 2026, the MERRL will go into enforcement for all cloud hosted mailboxes in the WWMT environment including existing tenants.</p><p style=\"margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:7.5pt;margin-left:0in\">Please refer to the ACS email documentation (Prepare an email communication resource for Azure Communication Services - An Azure Communication Services concept article | Microsoft Learn) or reach out to your Microsoft account team for further support in this journey.</p><p style=\"margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:7.5pt;margin-left:0in\"><b>Please note:</b> We have made the decision to not proceed with this change for DoD, GCC, or GCC High organizations at this time. We will communicate via Message center when we are ready to proceed. The External Recipient Rate Limit will only apply to WWMT/Production.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:7.5pt;margin-left:0in\">Please refer to the ACS email documentation (Prepare an email communication resource for Azure Communication Services - An Azure Communication Services concept article | Microsoft Learn) or reach out to your Microsoft account team for further support in this journey.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:7.5pt;margin-left:0in\"> ________________________________________\n</p><p style=\"margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:7.5pt;margin-left:0in\"><br></p><p style=\"margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:7.5pt;margin-left:0in\">Today, we are announcing that, beginning in April 2026 (previously October 2025), Exchange Online will begin enforcing an external recipient rate limit of 2000 recipients in 24 hours.</p><p>Exchange Online does not support bulk or high-volume transactional email. We have not enforced limiting of bulk email until now, but we plan on doing so with the introduction of an External Recipient Rate (ERR) limit. The ERR limit is being introduced to help reduce unfair usage and abuse of Exchange Online resources. </p><p><b>When this will happen:</b></p><p>The new ERR limit will be introduced in 2 phases:</p><p>Phase 1 - Starting April 1, 2026, (previously October 2025) the limit will apply to cloud-hosted mailboxes of trial tenants and all tenants created after this date.&nbsp;</p><p>Phase 2 – Starting October 1, 2026, (previously April 2026) we will start applying the limit to cloud-hosted mailboxes of existing tenants.&nbsp;</p><p> <b>How this will affect your organization:</b></p><p>Exchange Online enforces a Recipient Rate limit of 10000 recipients for cloud-hosted mailboxes. The 2000 ERR limit will become a sublimit within this 10000 Recipient Rate limit. There is no change to the Recipient Rate limit, and both of these will be rolling limits for 24-hour windows. You can send to up to 2,000 external recipients in a 24-hour period, and if you max out the external recipient rate limit then you will still be able to send to up to 8,000 internal recipients in that same period. If you don't send to any external recipients in a 24-hour period, you can send to up to 10,000 internal recipients.</p><p>For example:\n</p><ul><li>You use a cloud-hosted mailbox to send to 1,000 external recipients and 2,000 internal recipients at 6:00AM on Day 1, for a total of 3,000 recipients. You then send to another 1,000 external recipients at 8:00AM on Day 1. Because you sent to 2,000 external recipients, you will be blocked from sending to external recipients until 6:00AM on Day 2. During this period, you are able to send to up to 6,000 internal recipients, but for this example, let's assume that you don't.\n</li><li>At 6:00AM on Day 2, the 1,000 external recipients and 2,000 internal recipients sent at 6:00AM on Day 1 will no longer count toward the 24-hour limit calculation. Thus, from 6:00-8:00AM on Day 2, you can send to up to 9,000 total recipients (e.g., 9,000 internal or 8,000 internal plus 1,000 external).\n</li><li>If you don't send to any internal or external recipients during this period, then at 8:00AM on Day 2 you can again send to 10,000 recipients total with up to 2,000 of them being external recipients.</li></ul><p>\n</p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b><br></p><p>If you have a cloud-hosted mailbox that needs to exceed the ERR limit, you can move to <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/communication-services/concepts/email/email-overview\" target=\"_blank\">Azure Communication Services for Email</a>, which is designed specifically for high volume email sent to recipients external to your tenant.</p>",

The app permission policies for existing customers are migrated to maintain existing app availability in the tenant.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"\">This message is associated with Microsoft 365 Roadmap ID <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/roadmap?rtc=1%26filters%3D&amp;searchterms=151829\" target=\"_blank\">151829&nbsp;</a> </p><p style=\"\"><b>When this will happen:</b></p><p style=\"\">This feature will gradually roll out across three major phases.</p><p style=\"\">Phase 1 (Complete):  Auto-migration for only single policy customers - This is applicable for customer with only a global permission policy.

This is the preferred way for customers to have tenant admin to be in the loop of migration. The migration Wizard is extended until mid-May (previously end of March 2025) for customers with one or more custom app permission policies with users assigned to them. There will be no further exceptions granted.</p><p style=\"\">Phase 3: Auto-migration for all customers – This is for customers who have not completed self-migration in Phase 2. This has started in mid-April and will complete by mid-May 2025 for customers with custom permission policies, but no users assigned to them. All other customers will be auto-migrated starting in mid-May until end of June 2025 (previously starting April 2025).&nbsp; Auto-migration will maintain the same access defined in app permission policies whenever there is no conflict between a user’s assigned policies. If a user’s policies conflict by allowing and blocking the same app for them, we will auto-migrate their app as allowed. After auto-migration, there will be a security group created for each set of users assigned to each app permission policy. These groups will be assigned to each app they are allowed in their respective policy, maintaining their app access. Groups Administrators can manage these groups like any others to customize the app centric management assignments, such as adding and removing users, or removing the group and replacing it with another.</p><p style=\"\"><b>How this will affect your organization:</b></p><p style=\"\">Starting with this release, you can:</p><p style=\"\">1.

      "Content": "<p>Direct Send is a method used to send emails directly to a Microsoft Exchange Online customer’s hosted mailboxes from on-premises devices, applications, or third-party cloud services using the customer’s own accepted domain. It is an advanced method of sending messages to your users and requires proper configuration of SPF, DKIM, and DMARC to ensure messages are delivered successfully.</p><p>Many customers do not need to use Direct Send. Because SPF protections do not always outright block messages and sometimes deliver them to the Junk folder, it is possible for malicious senders mimicking Direct Send to have their messages that spoof your own domains land in the Junk folder and potentially confuse your users. Before this rollout, no feature existed to block Direct Send traffic for customers who have no need to use it. We will roll out the new <i>Reject Direct Send</i> setting for Exchange Online.</p><p><b>When this will happen:</b>\n</p><p>Public Preview: Available now.</p><p>General Availability (Worldwide, GCC, GCC High): We will begin rolling out early September 2025 and expect to complete by early September 2025.</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b></p><p>Direct Send covers anonymous messages sent from your own domain to your organization’s mailboxes and so enabling this setting will block any of that traffic. Direct Send traffic may include third-party services that you have given permission to use your domain or one of your own email applications hosted on-premises. To avoid having these messages rejected when this feature is enabled, they need to be authenticated. You can authenticate them by creating a <i>partner mail flow connector</i> for these messages.    \n</p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b>\n</p><p>This rollout has happened automatically by the specified dates with no admin action required before the rollout. Review your current configuration to assess the impact on your organization. You may want to notify your users about this change and update your relevant documentation.\n</p><p>By default, the new opt-in <code>RejectDirectSend</code> setting is set to <code>False</code>.  To enable the Reject Direct Send feature, Exchange Online admins can run this Microsoft PowerShell cmdlet: \n</p><p><code>Set-OrganizationConfig -RejectDirectSend $true</code>\n</p><p>The change should propagate out to your entire service within 30 minutes. With the feature enabled, any received Direct Send messages will see the following message:  \n</p><p><code>550 5.7.68 TenantInboundAttribution; Direct Send not allowed for this organization from unauthorized sources</code> \n</p><p>Unless you re-enable Direct Send, any messages that hit this error will need a partner connector created to authenticate their source as an approved sender.  \n</p><p>Learn more: <a href=\"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/exchange/introducing-more-control-over-direct-send-in-exchange-online/4408790\" target=\"_blank\">Introducing more control over Direct Send in Exchange Online | Microsoft Community Hub</a></p><p>We invite Exchange admins to try out the feature and provide feedback that we can use to validate and proceed to offering this feature for General Availability.</p>",

Expect no further delays beyond this date. Please review the information below for more details.\n</p><p>Updated October 18, 2024: We have updated the SMTP AUTH Clients Submission Report in the Exchange admin center, adding the Authentication Protocol column to show if Basic auth or OAuth is being used to submit email to Exchange Online. The data will build up over the next 90 days. Thank you for your patience.\n</p><p>Today, we are announcing that Exchange Online will permanently remove support for Basic authentication with Client Submission (SMTP AUTH) gradually beginning with a small percentage of submission rejections for all tenants on March 1st 2026 and reaching 100% rejections on April 30th 2026, (previously September 2025). After this time, applications and devices will no longer be able to use Basic auth as an authentication method and must use OAuth when using SMTP AUTH to send email.\n</p><p>Basic auth is a legacy authentication method that sends usernames and passwords in plain text over the network. This makes it vulnerable to credential theft, phishing, and brute force attacks.

Starting in July 2025, we will send monthly Message Center posts to tenants who are using Basic auth with Client Submission (SMTP AUTH) to alert them to the upcoming change.\n</p><p>Starting March 1st 2026 (previously September 2025) we will gradually start rejecting Basic Auth requests to the Client Submission (SMTP AUTH) endpoints, increasing to 100% rejection by the end of the April 2026. \n</p><p>The Client Submission (SMTP AUTH) endpoints in scope for this change are:\n</p><p>•\tsmtp.office365.com\n</p><p>•\tsmtp-legacy.office365.com\n</p><p>Once Basic auth is permanently disabled, any clients or apps connecting using Basic auth with Client Submission (SMTP AUTH) will receive this response:\n</p><p>•\t550 5.7.30 Basic authentication is not supported for Client Submission.\n</p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b>\n</p><p>If your client supports OAuth, follow these steps: <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/exchange/client-developer/legacy-protocols/how-to-authenticate-an-imap-pop-smtp-application-by-using-oauth\" target=\"_blank\">Authenticate an IMAP, POP or SMTP connection using OAuth</a>\n</p><p>If your client doesn’t support OAuth and you must use Basic Auth with Client Submission (SMTP AUTH), you will need to switch to one of the following alternatives before April 2026, previously September 2025:\n</p><p>•\tIf you are using basic authentication with Client Submission (SMTP AUTH) to send emails to recipients internal to your tenant, you can use Microsoft 365 High Volume Email.

DSI enables data security admins to efficiently identify incident-relevant content by searching their Microsoft 365 data estate to locate emails, Teams messages, Copilot prompts and responses, and documents. Once the investigation is scoped, DSI’s generative AI capabilities allow admins to gain deeper insights into the impacted data, revealing critical security risks and sensitive information. Investigative capabilities include the ability to categorize evidence, perform vector searches, and examine impacted data for security and sensitive data risks. To mitigate identified risks, DSI facilitates secure collaboration between partner teams.

      "Content": "<p>Updated June 6, 2025: Enforcement actions on unlicensed OneDrive accounts are ongoing. Please continue to monitor your <a href=\"http://spo.ms/admin#/oneDriveAccounts/management\" target=\"_blank\">Unlicensed OneDrive Account report</a>, as all accounts listed will be subject to enforcement if no action is taken.  To support more informed decision-making, we’ve introduced new and more granular reasons for why an account may appear unlicensed but and has not been deleted. This added detail should help you take the appropriate actions for each case and will be available in your Unlicensed OneDrive Accounts report no later than June 24th.  In some cases, admin action is required to delete the accounts. The timeline for enforcement remains unchanged from our last update.</p><p>Enforcement began on January 27, 2025. The rollout has slowed to ensure a safe roll-out with sufficient time for admins to adjust. Admins should anticipate that it takes time for all unlicensed accounts to complete the enforcement process. The initial enforcement rollout will be complete by October 29, 2025.</p><p><b>Timeline for accounts unlicensed before July 28, 2025\n</b></p><ul><li>September 26, 2025: By this date, all unlicensed accounts transition to read-only mode. Admins are advised to check after this date. Checking earlier can result in an incomplete status snapshot.\n</li><li>October 29, 2025: By this date, all unlicensed accounts are archived. Admins are advised to check after this date. Checking earlier can result in an incomplete status snapshot.</li></ul><p><b>Timeline for accounts unlicensed after July 28, 2025</b></p><ul><li>For accounts unlicensed after July 28, 2025, the account will be put into read-only mode on the 60th unlicensed day, and will be archived or moved to the recycle bin on the 93rd unlicensed day.\n</li></ul><p><b>Example:\n</b></p><ul><li>Unlicensed Date: October 1, 2025\n</li><li>Day 60: Nov 30, 2025. The account is placed in read-only mode. </li><li>Day 93: January 2, 2026: The account is archived. If the user is still active in Entra ID but the admin hasn't enabled billing, then this is also the date on which the account will begin the deprovisioning process.</li><li>Admins are encouraged to monitor account statuses based on these timelines to ensure compliance and take any necessary actions.</li></ul><p><b>When will this happen:</b> \n</p><p>&nbsp;General Availability (Worldwide): We began rolling out late January 2025 and expect to complete by late October 2025 (previously late March).</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization</b>\n</p><p>After this storage policy goes into effect in your tenant, any OneDrive user accounts that have been unlicensed for more than 93 days will be archived automatically and will become inaccessible to end users. Admins can view these accounts with admin tools, but the accounts will not be accessible to users until admins take action on them. For example, a OneDrive account that became unlicensed on August 1, 2025 will be inaccessible to users as of October 1, 2025.</p><p>As an admin, you can view a list of unlicensed accounts in your tenant by navigating to SharePoint admin center &gt; <i>Reports &gt; OneDrive accounts</i>. Some admins will have access to this page as soon as July 26, 2024, but most admins will be able to access the page closer to August 16, 2024.\n</p><ul><li>Set up the Archive billing for unlicensed accounts to be able to access and edit the archived files.\n</li><li>Delete the unlicensed OneDrive account, if it does not have a retention policy applied to it. \n</li><li>Renew the unlicensed account to maintain access.\n</li></ul><p></p><p>The <i>Unlicensed OneDrive accounts</i> page that will be in Microsoft admin center:\n</p><p><img src=\"https://cxcs.microsoft.net/file/messagecenter/en-us/8f5c65a0-5515-49e1-b876-07e81c69a89a\" style=\"width: 400px;\" alt=\"admin controls\"> \n</p><p>After the unlicensed accounts are automatically archived, you can access the files in these accounts by enabling unlicensed account billing in the Microsoft 365 admin center. Once enabled, unlicensed account billing applies to all unlicensed OneDrive accounts in your tenant. There is a fee of $0.05/GB/month to store unlicensed accounts in the Microsoft 365 Archive, and a fee of $0.60/GB to reactivate accounts stored in the Microsoft 365 Archive. Account reactivation takes up to 24 hours and provides 30 days of access to the account, and then the account returns to an archived state.\n</p><p>If you take no action for OneDrive accounts that have been unlicensed for longer than 93 days, these accounts will remain inaccessible to end users until you set up an Azure subscription and enable unlicensed account billing in the Microsoft SharePoint admin center. This action will not affect tenants who have not changed the default tenant retention settings.\n</p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare</b>\n</p><p>To prepare for this change, admins can view a list of all the unlicensed OneDrive accounts in their tenant by going to the SharePoint admin center and navigating to <i>Reports &gt; OneDrive accounts</i> (this page will be rolled out to admins between July 26, 2024 and August 16, 2024). This page will provide the number of unlicensed accounts and why the accounts are unlicensed. You may have unlicensed accounts in your tenant for four reasons: \n</p><ol><li>Retention period – Account is no longer licensed but is still active because a retention period setting is keeping the account from being deleted.\n</li><li>Retention policy – Account is no longer licensed but is still active because a retention policy in Purview is keeping the account from being deleted. \n</li><li>Active user with no license – Account is active but is not licensed. This can happen if the license is removed but the user is not removed from Microsoft Entra ID (formerly Azure Active Directory).  \n</li><li>Duplicate accounts – Account is a duplicate because a licensed user has multiple OneDrive accounts associated with them. Duplicate accounts (also known as non-primary accounts) may arise if a user has geographic move, if a user leaves and then rejoins an organization, or from other factors. \n</li></ol><p>After you have taken inventory of your unlicensed accounts, we recommend that you take the following action before January 27, 2025. \n</p><ol><li>Delete unlicensed accounts that you no longer wish to retain. \n</li><li>Set up billing for accounts that you wish to retain.\n</li><li>You may want to notify your users about this change and update any relevant documentation.\n</li></ol><p>*<b>At this time, these changes do not apply to customers in Education tenants. An Education tenant is any tenant with more than 50% education licenses. Any tenant with fewer than 50% education licenses is considered commercial.&nbsp;</b>However, for any education tenant, unlicensed OneDrive accounts consume pooled storage and can pose security and compliance risks. IT admins can view the unlicensed accounts on the <i>OneDrive accounts</i> page to identify unlicensed accounts and take action.</p><p><i>Learn more</i>\n</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/SharePoint/unlicensed-onedrive-accounts\" target=\"_blank\">Manage unlicensed OneDrive user accounts - SharePoint in Microsoft 365 | Microsoft Learn</a>\n</li><li><a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/sharepoint/retention-and-deletion\" target=\"_blank\">OneDrive retention and deletion - SharePoint in Microsoft 365 | Microsoft Learn</a>\n</li><li><a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/admin/add-users/delete-a-user?view=o365-worldwide\" target=\"_blank\">Delete a user from your organization - Microsoft 365 admin | Microsoft Learn</a></li></ul><p></p>",

These challenges are particularly noticeable for participants joining remotely, using assistive technologies, or communicating through different modalities.</p><p>Before this rollout, sign language users face several challenges during meetings, including difficulty locating and identifying their interpreters, as well as ensuring proper positioning of interpreter video feeds. Furthermore, active speaker detection prioritizes audio, resulting in participants who communicate through sign language often receiving less visual prominence than verbal speakers. These challenges make it more difficult for Deaf and hard-of-hearing participants to remain fully engaged during meetings.\n</p><p>In Microsoft Teams, we are committed to addressing these gaps, with a particular focus on enhancing the meeting experience for Deaf and hard-of-hearing participants who communicate using sign language.

Interpreters will be clearly identified in the participant roster and visually distinguished throughout meetings.

Thank you for your patience.\n</p><p>This message applies to Microsoft Teams for iOS/Android.</p><p>Microsoft is updating its policies regarding the sharing of user location data to enhance privacy, improve data security, and ensure compliance with evolving regulatory standards. To enhance transparency and user control, Teams will introduce a new location consent experience that gives users the choice of when and how Teams can use their location data <b>specifically, the <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/win32/nativewifi/wi-fi-access-location-changes\" target=\"_blank\">SSID (service set identifier) and the BSSID (basic service set identifier</a>)</b>.</p><p><b>When this will happen:</b>\n</p><p>General Availability (Worldwide, GCC): We will begin rolling out early June 2025 (previously mid-May) and expect to complete by late May (previously early May).\n</p><p>General Availability (GCC High, DoD): We will begin rolling out late May 2025 (previously early May) and expect to complete by mid-June 2025 (previously early June).\n</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b></p><p>All new and existing Teams for Work users in your organization will be prompted to specify if they want to keep location detection on for emergency calls only or if they consent to allowing location access used for <i>IT Admin Insights</i>, for troubleshooting (with a tool such as the <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/cqd-what-is-call-quality-dashboard\" target=\"_blank\">Call Quality Dashboard</a>) or for <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/configure-dynamic-emergency-calling\" target=\"_blank\">Network and Location matching through BSSID</a> for emergency calling location.\n</p><p><b>NOTE: </b>The new Teams location consent flow does not apply to fully managed devices where users are restricted from user-granted location access. You can expect current policies for managed devices to continue working as expected, and users will not receive the new location consent prompts.\n</p><p>The new Teams location consent changes will impact these Teams features:\n</p><ul><li><i>Emergency calling</i></li><li><i>Location-based routing\n</i></li><li><i>Network </i>and <i>Location </i>matching through BSSID</li><li><i>Call Quality Dashboard </i></li></ul><p>This change will be available by default.\n</p><p>All new Teams for Work users on iOS and Android will first be prompted to allow location permission at the operating system level:\n</p><p><img src=\"https://cxcs.microsoft.net/file/ccp/en-us/f1af9c7e-c484-469e-94cc-5f9491f48a54\" style=\"width: 280px;\" alt=\"user settings\">\n</p><p>Existing Teams for Work users who previously accepted or denied location permission at the operating system level will not see this prompt a second time.\n</p><p>If a user allows location access, dynamic emergency calling policies will work as configured, and users enabled for <i>Location Based Routing</i> will be able to make and receive PSTN calls.</p><p>If a user disallows location access, several Teams <i>Call Quality Dashboard</i> metrics will be impacted, and <i>Network </i>and <i>Location </i>matching through BSSID from dynamic emergency calling policies will not work. Users can still manually add their physical address for emergency calls in the Teams Calls app if an admin has enabled <code>ExternalLocationLookupMode</code> for their users. \n</p><p>Immediately after users consent to allow location access at the operating system level (and for users who previously consented to location access), both new and existing Teams for Work users will be prompted to allow location access at the Teams app level:\n</p><p><img src=\"https://cxcs.microsoft.net/file/ccp/en-us/85081194-9eca-47e8-b165-cf6ba502e4c5\" style=\"width: 280px;\" alt=\"user settings\">\n</p><p>At the Teams level, users must choose between <i>Allow all,</i> which grants Teams full location access (that can be used for emergency calls, IT Admin Insights, or troubleshooting), or<i> Allow emergency only, </i>which restricts location usage to emergency calling. <b>NOTE:</b> Only users who are configured for a dynamic emergency calling policy through <code>ExternalLocationLookUpMode</code> will see this version of the dialog. Users without <code>ExternalLocationLookUpMode</code> enabled will see a slightly different version of this consent prompt that excludes emergency calling. Users can modify their location detection preferences at the operating system level or app level at any time in Teams <i>Settings &gt; Privacy &gt; Location.</i> On fully managed devices, these settings will be on by default and can only be disabled at the operating system level. \n</p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b>\n</p><p>We recommend that you educate your users on these selections and what works best for your tenant. \n</p><ol><li>If you regularly use the Call Quality Dashboard or leverage Network and Location matching through BSSID, you may want to recommend that users allow location access for those options, or user location data will no longer flow to these services. </li><li>For emergency calling, you can communicate these changes by setting the emergency service disclaimer with a custom message that will display in the Calls app in Teams. Ensuring that users have location turned on is crucial for proper functioning of emergency calls and their safety.

Microsoft Teams Android devices will be migrating to this platform. The first step in the migration is a firmware update to Microsoft Teams Android devices in 2024. The firmware update will move devices from Android device administrator to Android AOSP management.</p><p><b>When this will happen:</b></p><p>A Preview program for select Microsoft Teams Android devices is targeted for Q2 of calendar year 2024. General release of the firmware update with the Android AOSP management stack will happen starting in Q4 of calendar year 2024 throughout Q1 of calendar year 2025 for all eligible Microsoft Teams Android devices. Auto updates will commence starting May 15th into Q3 calendar year 2025.</p><p>Eligible Microsoft Teams Android devices will initially receive a manual firmware update in Teams Admin Center so IT admins can manually verify the migration on their own schedule on select devices of their choosing.</p><p>Eventually, the firmware update for migration will be scheduled as an automatic firmware update in Teams Admin Center. This automatic firmware update can be deferred for up to 60 days from first availability based upon the admin configured stages in Teams Admin Center.</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b></p><p>The firmware upgrade, including the support for Intune management of Android (AOSP) devices must be accepted. It can be deferred for up to 60 days after it is first available.

Which is why we allow co-organizer to be added to the event so they can work alongside or on behalf of the organizer. So far co-organizers were able to set up event theming, manage registration, meeting options, view reports and more but were not able to edit event details like title, date/time, description, event group; nor publish or cancel event. Now they can! Co-organizer can edit event details, publish, and cancel the event like the organizer can.

This setting will retain the existing configuration and will be disabled by default. Setting name: <i>Service principals can create workspaces, connections, and deployment pipelines.</i></li><li>Service principal access to permission-based APIs: Controls access to APIs protected by the Fabric permission model, including managing existing workspaces and full CRUD (create, read, update, and delete) operations for workspace sub-folders and items. This setting will adopt the existing configuration of the current setting and will be enabled by default. Setting name: <i>Service principals can call Fabric public APIs.</i></li></ul><p><b>Why are we introducing the change?\n</b></p><p>For years, one tenant admin setting has governed the access of service principals to public APIs in Microsoft Power BI and then in Microsoft Fabric overall (see screenshot of the current setting).\n</p><p>We originally introduced the single setting as a safeguard against potential misuse by multi-tenant app service principals, but as we have expanded into Fabric scenarios, we understand the need for a more flexible approach to unblock Fabric developers.

Thank you for your patience.</p><p>In 2018, <a href=\"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/exchange-team-blog/upcoming-changes-to-exchange-web-services-ews-api-for-office-365/ba-p/608055\" target=\"_blank\">we announced</a> that we were no longer making feature updates to Exchange Web Services (EWS) in Exchange Online, and we advised developers to move to Microsoft Graph. </p><p>In September 2023, we announced that on October 1, 2026, we will start blocking EWS requests to Exchange Online. \n</p><p>\n</p><p>We are now less than 18 months from October 1, 2026. We have made progress on closing several parity gaps with more changes in development to be released in the coming quarters. Please refer to <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/exchange/clients-and-mobile-in-exchange-online/deprecation-of-ews-exchange-online\" target=\"_blank\">Deprecation of Exchange Web Services in Exchange Online</a> for up-to-date guidance and roadmap information.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>If you haven't already, start the process of working with your application development organization and your application vendors to migrate active EWS applications on your tenant to the Graph API.&nbsp;</p><p>\n</p><p><b>When this will happen:</b></p><p>October 1, 2026</p><p><b>How this affects your organization:</b></p><p>While the EWS components of the service will continue to receive security updates and certain non-security updates, product design and features will remain unchanged. This change also applies to the EWS SDKs for Java and .NET, as well.\n</p><p>Despite this announcement, EWS is still available and supported for use in production environments. But we strongly suggest migrating to Microsoft Graph to access Exchange Online data and gain access to the latest features and functionality.\n</p><p>Today’s update and the retirement of EWS apply only to Microsoft 365 and Exchange Online (all environments); there are no changes to EWS in Exchange Server. Further, the changes in Exchange Online do not affect Outlook for Windows or Mac, Teams, or any other Microsoft product.</p><p>In our original blog post, we said this change would affect only third-party (non-Microsoft) applications.<b> We have expanded our effort and are now also removing EWS dependencies from Microsoft apps and services, and we’re going to complete that work well before October 2026</b>. We intend to do this as quickly as possible without affecting the quality of service or product.&nbsp;</p><p>There may be applications running on your tenant created by your organization or 3rd parties that use EWS. <b>We recommend <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/admin/activity-reports/ews-usage?view=o365-worldwide\" target=\"_blank\">reviewing your application portfolio</a> now </b>to get an understanding of which apps need to be updated by your organization and which applications require updates from vendors.</p><p>It is important to get started with this effort as soon as possible as the Graph API patterns are quite different from EWS. Equivalent Graph API operations may exhibit subtle differences that affect your use cases and application designs in unanticipated ways.</p><p>Migrating Applications to Microsoft Graph&nbsp;</p><p>We know there are several feature gaps between EWS and Microsoft Graph, and though the list below is not exhaustive, these are the gaps most frequently reported to us by developers:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Access to Archive Mailboxes – We are working on delivering access to archive mailboxes via Microsoft Graph and will provide an updated timeline in the coming months.\n</li><li>Folder Associated Information / User Configuration – We are working on these features and will provide an updated timeline in the coming months.\n</li><li>Exchange Online Management – We are investigating solutions for this and will provide an updated timeline in the coming months.</li><li>Access to Public Folders – After evaluating the usage of public folders, we have decided to restrict programmatic access to public folders to supported Outlook clients only, and for bulk import/export purposes. We will not provide APIs for programmatically creating, reading, updating and deleting public folders after October 2026 (also see <a href=\"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/exchange/security-related-updates-in-exchange-online/4303525\" target=\"_blank\">Security Related Updates in Exchange Online</a>).&nbsp;</li></ul><div><br></div><p>We know there are other gaps not listed above, and we continue to work on closing them, but it’s possible some functionality will not make it to Microsoft Graph. We encourage you to refer to <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/exchange/clients-and-mobile-in-exchange-online/deprecation-of-ews-exchange-online\" target=\"_blank\">Deprecation of Exchange Web Services in Exchange Online</a> for up-to-date guidance and roadmap information.&nbsp;</p><p><b>Next Steps\n</b></p><p>The retirement of these APIs follows our <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/lifecycle/policies/modern\" target=\"_blank\">Modern Lifecycle Policy</a>. We understand changes like this may cause some inconvenience, but we are confident it will ensure more secure, reliable, and performant experiences.\n</p><p>We will publish regular communications as we progress towards this deadline to aid affected tenants in identifying EWS usage. We encourage all customers to monitor Message Center and the Exchange Blog and <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/exchange/clients-and-mobile-in-exchange-online/deprecation-of-ews-exchange-online\" target=\"_blank\">Deprecation of Exchange Web Services in Exchange Online </a>for related content.&nbsp;</p><p>Thank you in advance for updating and opening your apps to a wider range of useful and intelligent features on Microsoft Graph. We are extremely excited about the growing opportunities that Microsoft Graph offers to developers, and we remain fully committed to our journey to empower developers to access Microsoft 365 data with the most modern features and tools.</p>",

Additionally, the sync experience on OneNote for Windows 10 may be slower compared to OneNote on Windows.\n</li><li><b>A Smooth Transition Experience</b>: Starting in July 2025, users of OneNote for Windows 10 will receive in-app banner notifications guiding them to switch to OneNote for Microsoft 365 ensuring a smooth transition and continuity in their workflow.</li></ul><p><b>What you can do to prepare:</b></p><p>To help your users transition smoothly, we recommend starting the migration process now.

      "Content": "<p>Coming soon: You will be able to extend Microsoft Purview to the network layer by integrating Purview with your preferred Secure Access Service Edge (SASE) / Security Service Edge (SSE) solution. Through this integration, admins can intercept and inspect traffic flowing through the network layer to identify the presence of sensitive data. This enables admins to detect sensitive data shared with untrusted cloud applications through browsers, applications, APIs, add-ins, and more, including common generative AI, cloud storage, and content sharing services. The signals from inline discovery for the network further enrich Purview solutions including Data Security Posture Management (DSPM) and Insider Risk Management (IRM), helping admins better understand how to reduce data exfiltration risks to locations outside of their organization.

Consequently, there will not be a dedicated page of work or school results and users’ work or school profiles will no longer appear on Bing.com.

In addition, the address bar will send users to work and school results on M365.cloud.microsoft rather than Bing.com. Users of the address bar can continue to find work-related documents, bookmarks, and people in suggested results—clicking on these suggestions takes users to work or school results on M365.cloud.microsoft. Users can also type \"work\" in the address bar, hit the tab key, then input their work- or school-related query to get results on a M365.cloud.microsoft page. Work and school search results will include documents, people, and bookmarks. Work search for documents will be available initially, with additional content types available as quickly as possible.\n</li><li>The Windows search box will no longer display organization branding nor the “Work” or “School” tab but will continue to support work and school search. Search for documents and people remains available. will be available initially, with additional content types available as quickly as possible.

(For details on changes, please refer to the FAQ: https://aka.ms/MSBFAQ.)\n</p><p>Users who click on suggestions in the Edge for Business address bar or Windows search box may be redirected to Microsoft365.com before March 31, 2025. Also, as we begin testing the retirement experience, a small set of users may find before March 31 that Bing is intermittently unavailable as an entry point for work search. We recommend that you proactively inform your users of the change and direct them to M365.cloud.microsoft (formerly Office.com and Microsoft365.com) and SharePoint Online. Adding M365.cloud.microsoft to their favorites or to the favorites bar in Edge for Business may be a helpful alternative pathway. \n</p><p><b>What you can do to prepare:</b></p><p>Customers should prepare to stop using Microsoft Search in Bing by March 31, 2025, and transition to using Microsoft Search through M365.cloud.microsoft (formerly Office.com and Microsoft365.com) and SharePoint Online. We recommend that you inform users about the upcoming change and the alternatives available. \n</p><p>Adding your preferred entry point from this set to favorites or favorites bar in Edge may be a helpful alternative pathway. Admins can easily set favorites in Edge for their organization, please see details here. \n</p><p>Additionally, users can continue to use the Edge for Business address bar and the Windows search box, with some changes expected. Please educate users that they should now type \"work\" in the address bar, hit the tab key, then type in their work-related query to get work results on a M365.cloud.microsoft page.\n</p><p>If your organization is using the <code>AddressBarMicrosoftSearchInBingProviderEnabled</code> policy today, you should update to the <code>AddressBarWorkSearchResultsEnabled</code> policy, if the policy is still needed.   \n</p><p>The new policy, <code>AddressBarWorkSearchResultsEnabled</code>, will be available starting in early March, with Edge for Business version 134 (ahead of the Microsoft Search in Bing deprecation). This allows admins to configure the display of work suggestions in the address bar. If the policy is enabled or not configured, users who are signed into Edge for Business with their Entra ID can view internal work-related suggestions, such as bookmarks, files, and people results powered by Microsoft 365, in the Edge for Business address bar suggestion dropdown. If the policy is disabled, Entra ID signed-in users will not see internal workplace results in the Microsoft Edge address bar suggestion dropdown. \n</p><p>Admins who wish to set their own deprecation date prior to March 31, 2025, can turn off Microsoft Search in Bing by going to the Microsoft 365 admin center &gt; Settings &gt; Search &amp; Intelligence.\n</p><p>Regarding SafeSearch settings: \n</p><ul><li>If you had set the search experience for your organization to “School search,” SafeSearch was set to Strict by default. If you’d like to ensure that your users continue to have SafeSearch set to Strict after the Microsoft Search in Bing retirement, you can map www.bing.com to strict.bing.com at a network level.

This feature is essential for enhancing data security, ensuring compliance, and providing peace of mind to organizations concerned about unauthorized data dissemination.\n</p><p>This message is associated with Microsoft 365 Roadmap ID <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?searchterms=483158\" target=\"_blank\">483158</a>.</p><p><b>When this will happen:</b>\n</p><p>Public Preview: We will begin rolling out late April 2025 and expect to complete by mid-May 2025.\n</p><p>General Availability (Worldwide, GCC, GCC High, DoD): We will begin rolling out late May 2025 and expect to complete by mid-June 2025.\n</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b>\n</p><p>After this rollout, admins can use the new predicates in Data Loss Prevention &gt; <i>Policy settings &gt; Create rule &gt; Unique recipients greater than</i> and <i>Unique domains greater than</i> to take action on emails based on the number of recipients or domains in the email:\n</p><p><img src=\"https://cxcs.microsoft.net/file/ccp/en-us/b62fba4b-226a-4f91-af70-9b5b200017a2\" style=\"width: 400px;\" alt=\"admin settings\">\n</p><p>This change will be available by default for admins to configure.\n</p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b>\n</p><p>This rollout will happen automatically by the specified dates with no admin action required before the rollout.

Rollout for scheduled meetings and channel Meet Now will be started in early July 2025 and expected to be completed by mid-July 2025. </p><p>General Availability (GCC High, DoD):&nbsp; We will begin rolling out early August 2025 (previously early June) and expect to complete by mid-August 2025 (previously late June).</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b>\n</p><p>The new URL syntax is: https://teams.microsoft.com/meet/&lt;meeting_id&gt;?p=&lt;HashedPasscode&gt; \n</p><p>To make meeting URL shorter, we are removing several parameters such as tenant ID, conversation ID etc. This change serves two main goals: 1) improving usability of URL during sharing and 2) making the URL more secure and less susceptible to malicious attacks. \n</p><p>Here are some details about how meeting links work and when they expire: \n</p><ol><li>In case the meeting organizer gets removed from the tenant, the links to the meetings scheduled by them automatically expire. \n</li><li>&nbsp;Every meeting link expires in 60 days after the scheduled event or in 8 hours, if it was created as Meet Now. Learn more about expiration timelines for different types of meetings. \n</li></ol><p>With the Short Meeting URL release, expiration limit will be applied to all newly created links. \n</p><p>Once the change to Short Meeting URL is released, all newly created meetings will expire as described in the documentation: 60 days after meeting ends for scheduled meetings and 8 hours after creation for Meet Now. Once this expiry period is over, in case someone clicks the link (e.g. outside of Teams app OR in the meeting details inside Teams calendar section), they will be unable to join the meeting.</p><p>Note: Old links created before short meeting URL release will continue working as it previously was (user will be able to join even after the documented expiry limits).</p><p>The reason why we are making this change is simple: security is our topmost priority. Maintaining a high security level is essential to protect sensitive data, prevent financial losses, ensure business continuity, and meet compliance and legal obligations. It is a critical aspect of modern digital life and business operations. This adjustment is designed to enhance the security of Teams meeting links, thereby better safeguarding the customer tenant. We want to be on par with modern security standards, that’s why the new behavior is a step in the right direction that we must take. It’s not possible to keep the current behavior. If you think it breaks some of your business processes, please leave comment to the MC post and describe your case there. \n</p><p>Recommendations in case the meeting link has expired:  \n</p><p>For meeting organizer: We recommend scheduling a new meeting. If the meeting organizer got removed from the tenant someone else should reschedule their meetings from scratch. \n</p><p>For participant: Please reach out to the meeting organizer and ask them to reschedule the meeting or send you an updated link.</p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b>\n</p><p>You may want to check if you have any integrations that use parameters from URL. After the rollout, the URL will only contain the meeting ID. Parameters such as tenant ID, organizer ID, conversation ID and message ID will not be in the URL. \n</p><p>You may inform meeting organizers from your tenant who use expired meeting links, or you may want to make a tenant-wide announcement about this change. \n</p><p>This rollout will happen automatically by the specified date with no admin action required. You may want to notify your users about this change and update any relevant documentation as appropriate.</p>",

The current behavior of the EWSEnabled flag is that it can be set at both the tenant (organization) level and the user (mailbox) level. Currently, when the flag is set to true at the user level, it takes precedence over the organization-level setting. If a setting is Null, it means the setting is not enforced at that level. If Org and user-level are both Null, the default behavior is to allow. This hierarchical structure means that if the organization-level flag is set to false, but the user-level flag is set to true, EWS requests from that user are still allowed. In summary:</p><table class=\"table table-bordered\"><tbody><tr><td>Organization Level</td><td>User Level&nbsp;</td><td>EWS Requests</td></tr><tr><td>True or &lt;null&gt;</td><td>True or &lt;null&gt;</td><td>Allowed</td></tr><tr><td>True or &lt;null&gt;</td><td>False</td><td>Not Allowed</td></tr><tr><td>False</td><td>True</td><td>Allowed</td></tr><tr><td>False</td><td>False or &lt;null&gt;</td><td>Not Allowed</td></tr></tbody></table><p>This approach has led to situations where it can be challenging for administrators to ensure uniform policy enforcement across their organization, particularly in large and complex environments.</p><p>New Behavior\n</p><p>To address these issues, we are altering the behavior so that EWS will only be allowed if both the organization-level and user-level EWSEnabled flags are true. Here's a simplified view of the new logic:</p><table class=\"table table-bordered\"><tbody><tr><td>Organization Level</td><td>&nbsp;User Level</td><td>EWS Requests</td></tr><tr><td>True or &lt;null&gt;</td><td>True or &lt;null&gt;</td><td>Allowed</td></tr><tr><td>True or &lt;null&gt;</td><td>False</td><td>Not Allowed</td></tr><tr><td>False</td><td>True or &lt;null&gt;</td><td>Not Allowed</td></tr><tr><td>False</td><td>False</td><td>Not Allowed</td></tr></tbody></table><p>In short, EWS will be permitted only if both the organization and user-level allow it. This change ensures that administrators have better control over EWS access and can enforce policies more consistently across their entire organization</p><p><b>Next Steps:</b>\n</p><p>Please check the blog for additional information and ensure your per-user and tenant wide settings are correct before this change is made to your tenant. \n</p><ul><li>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aka.ms/EWSEnabledChange\" target=\"_blank\">The way to control EWS usage in Exchange Online is changing</a>&nbsp;</li></ul><p><b><br></b></p>",

Classic Outlook and new Outlook are turned on in the new default configuration, and new Outlook will be added as \"on\" for existing configurations unless administrators edit to exclude it.

Migration guidance</i>:\n</p><p>We have developed a detailed <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoft-365-apps/deploy/deployment-guide-onenote\" target=\"_blank\">Deployment guide for OneNote</a> that includes best practices of migrating and a sample migration script. This sample script is designed to simplify the migration process for IT admins and to ensure that your users' unsynchronized data is backed up during migration. We believe this migration guidance will significantly help in achieving a successful migration process.\n</p><p><i>2. OneNote migration support in October 2024:</i>\n</p><p>To ensure a smooth transition, we are offering additional support from the OneNote team to help with the migration process for tenants who want to migrate early. The team is only available in the month of October 2024. After that, you will need to rely on the deployment guidance. To engage the OneNote team in October 2024, please provide feedback as usual on this post and include your email address.\n</p><p><i>3. App download restrictions for new users:</i></p><p>Starting November 1, 2024, new users will no longer be able to download OneNote for Windows 10 from the Microsoft Store. Given the app is approaching end of support and we are recommending using OneNote for Windows instead, we’re restricting new users from being able to install OneNote for Windows 10 moving forward. If you currently have the application installed, you will still be able to use it and receive updates until the end of support.\n</p><p>We are committed to supporting you through this transition and ensuring that your migration to OneNote for Windows is as seamless as possible.\n</p><p><i>Learn more\n</i></p><ul><li><a href=\"https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/XPFFZHVGQWWLHB?ocid=pdpshare\" target=\"_blank\">Download OneNote for Windows</a> from the Microsoft Store\n</li><li><a href=\"https://support.microsoft.com/office/what-is-happening-to-onenote-for-windows-10-2b453bfe-66bc-4ab2-9118-01e7eb54d2d6#:~:text=We%20recently%20announced%20the%20availability%20of%20the%20OneNote,Windows%2010%20will%20reach%20end-of-support%20in%20Oct%202025.\" target=\"_blank\">What is happening to OneNote for Windows 10 - Microsoft Support</a>\n</li><li><a href=\"https://support.microsoft.com/office/moving-to-onenote-on-windows-4ba7b498-aafc-44b1-8326-a582a6c71196\" target=\"_blank\">Moving to OneNote on Windows - Microsoft Support</a>\n</li><li><a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoft-365-apps/deploy/deployment-guide-onenote\" target=\"_blank\">Deployment guide for OneNote - Microsoft 365 Apps | Microsoft Learn</a></li></ul><p></p>",

Currently, when you make metadata changes such as title, description, transcripts, chapters, interactivity, thumbnails, media settings, etc. to files in Microsoft Stream, each of those changes cause new versions to be created. Each of these versions in Microsoft OneDrive and Microsoft SharePoint count the full file size towards consumed storage quota. Thus, for large video and audio files, these versions cause your storage consumption to quickly increase.<br></p><p>To prevent this, we are changing how Microsoft Stream handles versioning. Any changes made specifically to chapters and transcripts of files from Stream will stop making versions, thus preventing storage from increasing as rapidly as it has in the past.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>\n</p><p>This message is associated with Microsoft 365 Roadmap ID <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?filters=&amp;searchterms=395380\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"\">395380</a></p><p><b>When this will happen:</b></p><p>General Availability (Worldwide): We will begin rolling out mid-July 2024 and expect to complete by late August 2024.&nbsp;</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b>\n</p><p>Changes to video and audio files from Stream will no longer take version snapshots.

We have concluded  through  customer feedback that this change to our initial deprecation plan, by maintaining support   for Live Events, will empower customers to produce large events as established and provide more time to upgrade to town hall, our new digital streaming event solution for large events, on their own schedule. Town hall will continue to serve as the platform where we will deliver new product value to our customers.</p><p>Teams Live Events will continue to be supported. We want to ensure that customers can upgrade to town hall on their own schedule as we work to bring new features and capabilities to town hall.  Town  hall is already available for commercial customers in public clouds, and we are adding new features regularly.</p><p>If you are using Teams Live Events for your large-scale digital events, you can continue to do so past the previously announced deprecation date of September 30th, 2024. However, we encourage you to try town hall, which offers a more modern and interactive experience for your live events.&nbsp;</p><p>You don't need to do anything at this time to continue using Teams Live Events.

This provides commercial customers with a 12-month window to prepare for the retirement and transition off Teams Live Events.&nbsp;</p><p><b>When this will happen:</b></p><p>September 30, 2024</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b></p><p>After September 30, 2024, Teams Live Events will no longer be supported, and access will be discontinued. Customers will not be able to schedule, start, or join any events on Teams Live Events after this date. Existing recordings will be available to access until December 31, 2024. If customers want to retain any recordings from prior events, they will need to download the recordings and upload them to a different location before December 31, 2024. Between now and September 2024, customers can continue to use Teams Live Events with no change in their existing experience. However, our recommendation is that customers (both existing and new) transition to and start to use town halls as it becomes generally available on October 5, 2023.</p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b></p><p>To prepare your organization for the transition we advise:\n</p><ul><li>Start to use town hall as it becomes generally available on October 5.</li><li>Learn more about town hall when documentation becomes available on adoption.microsoft.com and learn.microsoft.com on October 5.</li><li>Start planning to download recordings your organization wishes to retain before December 31, 2024.</li></ul><p><br></p>",

Here are the end of support dates for perpetual versions of Office that include the Office Telemetry Dashboard: \n</p><ul><li>Microsoft Office 2013 – April 11, 2023 \n</li><li>Microsoft Office 2016 – October 14, 2025 \n</li><li>Microsoft Office 2019 – October 14, 2025 \n</li></ul><p> <b>How this will affect your organization:</b> </p><p>Once a device in your organization updates to Version 2208 or later of Microsoft 365 Apps, Office Telemetry Dashboard components will be either removed or become unsupported.</p><p>To access information about the COM and VSTO add-ins in your environment, you can use the inventory feature available in the Microsoft 365 Apps admin center \n</p><p> <b>What you need to do to prepare:</b></p><p>As the devices update to Version 2208 or later, the Office Telemetry Dashboard and Office Telemetry Agent will be automatically uninstalled from the devices.</p><p>However, the Office Telemetry Processor will need to be manually removed from devices using your standard management tools as there will be no new data for it to process. Similarly, the rest of the infrastructure including the shared folder and the SQL Server for permanent storage of telemetry data will become obsolete and therefore can be removed.  \n</p>",
