This update will come with several new enhancements, and we will also be retiring several features at this time. See each section below for more detail on the timing.</p><p><b>New features in the upcoming Planner update:</b></p><ul><li>These changes will be available with the new update, which we expect to begin rolling in mid-February 2026.\n</li><li><b>Tasks chats in basic plans</b> will allow team members to collaborate directly on tasks using rich text formatting and @mentions, making it easier to discuss work and notify teammates about what needs attention.</li><li><b>Goals in basic plans</b> for users with a Microsoft 365 Copilot license or a Planner premium license. Goals will allow teams to set clear, well-defined objectives to help prioritize work. By connecting tasks to shared goals, teams achieve greater alignment, gain clarity on priorities, and track progress and outcomes—driving the plan forward together.</li></ul><p><b>New features coming in subsequent Planner updates:</b></p><ul><li><b>Project manager agent </b>will be available in all plans for M365 Copilot licensed users, including basic plans. The Project Manager agent can help teams get work done faster by executing on tasks and can help drive alignment by writing comprehensive status reports based on plan updates.</li><li><b>Custom templates</b> will allow you to create reusable, pre-designed plan layouts tailored to your organization’s needs, ensuring consistency and saving time. They provide the ability to standardize content while allowing easy customization for specific scenarios.</li></ul><p><b>Features in Planner that will be retired:</b></p>\n<ul><li>We expect this rollout to begin between <b>mid-January 2026</b> and <b>mid-February 2026</b>.</li><li>The following changes will take effect as this build rolls out to your organization:</li><ul><li><b>A new <i>Task chat experience </i>will replace the prior <i>comments experience </i>for <i>basic plan</i> tasks:</b> <ul><li>As noted above, the previous task comments experience will be replaced by a new task chat feature that supports messages about the task that can include @mentions and rich text formatting, in response to a longstanding top customer request. Due to customer feedback on our notifications experience, the new chat feature only sends an email/Teams notification to a colleague that’s been @mentioned in the message. </li><li>The task chat experience will be available on Planner in Teams web/desktop and the Planner web experience, and the old experience for viewing comments will no longer be directly visible on a task. Instead, the task details pane will show a link to open a page in Outlook where task comments can be seen.</li><li>Users can continue to use and see the previous task comments experience in the iOS Planner app, Android Planner app, and Planner in Teams mobile. New task chat messages will not be visible in the mobile experience at this time.</li><li>There are no changes to email notifications for the existing task comments experience, meaning that an email notification will be sent to all group members associated with the plan when a task comment is added.</li><li>There is no change to the <b>premium plan</b> conversations feature at this time.</li></ul></li><li><b>The whiteboard tab for <i>premium plans</i> will be retired.</b> <ul><li>This feature automatically created a whiteboard for <b>premium plans</b> in Planner and allowed users to create tasks in Planner from that whiteboard's sticky notes. </li><li>The <b>whiteboard tab</b> will be unavailable on the <b>premium plan</b> after retirement of this feature.</li><li>Users will be unable to create tasks from a whiteboard as a result. </li><li>Any existing whiteboard content will remain available via the <b>Whiteboard app</b>. </li><li>There is no replacement for this feature at this time.</li></ul></li></ul></ul><p><b>Features in Planner that will be temporarily unavailable:</b></p><ul><li>We expect this rollout to begin between <b>mid-January 2026</b> and <b>mid-February 2026</b>.</li><li><b>Convert a <i>basic plan</i> to a <i>premium plan</i>&nbsp;will be temporarily unavailable.</b></li><ul><li> The ability to convert an existing <b>basic plan</b> to a <b>premium plan</b> will be unavailable. </li><li>We plan to make similar functionality available again in the future. </li><li>In the meantime, users will need to create a new <b>premium plan</b> and manually copy the tasks into the new plan.</li></ul></ul><p><b>Features that will be retired as we pursue a long‑term plan to bring equivalent capabilities:</b></p><ul><li>Planner component in Loop pages.<ul><li>This control, which could previously be inserted by typing /planner in a Loop workspace or pasting the link to a Plan, was one of the available options. This control will be retired between mid-January 2026 and mid-February 2026.</li><li>Loop pages support various options for capturing task information.

This initial phase targets tenants that have never modified their organization-wide defaults, app availability, or block/unblock in either the Microsoft 365 admin center or the Teams admin center.

This sometimes resulted in different settings for the same app in the two admin centers. With Unified agent app management, you will be able to manage apps on the Integrated apps page in the Microsoft 365 admin center or in the Teams admin center, and any changes made in either admin center will synchronize.</p><div>What you can expect:\n</div><ul><li>You’ll gain a consolidated view of agent and Microsoft 365 app availability across both Microsoft 365 and Teams admin centers.\n</li><li>Changes made in either admin center to the agent and app availability will automatically apply across all supported hosts.\n</li><li>Organization-wide defaults for both admin centers will be in sync and govern app availability across Teams, Outlook, and the Microsoft 365 copilot app.</li></ul><p><b>&nbsp;What you need to do to prepare</b></p><p>To ensure a smooth transition, review your tenant-level and individual agent/app settings (app allow/block &amp; user availability) in both the Microsoft 365 Admin Center and the Teams Admin Center. If different departments within your organization manage these settings, we suggest coordinating efforts to complete the review collaboratively.\n</p><p>This update will be rolled out automatically by the stated date, and no immediate action is required. However, it's a good time to update any internal documentation related to agent and app management policies.&nbsp;</p><p>Learn more: <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/uam-tac-mac\" target=\"_blank\">Unified agent and app availability management across Microsoft 365 and Teams Admin Centers - Microsoft Teams | Microsoft Learn&nbsp;</a></p><p>\n</p></li>",

Attach your high-resolution PNGs to the No Reply confirmation email. Thank you!\n</p><p>We are reiterating the guidance for connector settings to ensure customers are using healthy configurations. The key problematic configurations we are seeing are:\n</p><ol><li>When a tenant has an Inbound connector of type OnPremises and the connector does certificate-based authentication using a certificate with a subject/SAN for a domain that is NOT an Accepted Domain of the tenant.\n</li><li>When a tenant has an Inbound connector of type OnPremises and the connector does IP-based authentication, but the IP is used by other tenants On-Premises servers to connect to Exchange Online.\n</li></ol><p>These anti-patterns typically occur when you are using a 3rd party service to relay email through Exchange Online but could also occur if your organization has a single on-premises Exchange Server connecting to multiple Exchange Online tenants.\n</p><p>These configurations can cause incorrect mail flow because Exchange Online is a multi tenant service and relies on message attribution to determine which tenant an incoming message belongs to. When messages are received through an Inbound connector of type OnPremises, attribution is determined using the following priority order:\n</p><ol><li>The domain on the TLS certificate presented by the sending server\n</li><li>The P1 MailFrom (envelope sender) domain</li><li> The P1 RcptTo (recipient) domain</li></ol><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b>\n</p><p>We may perform internal changes, such as tenant moves, without notice, which can impact mail flow if a tenant has a bad connector configuration. This means a misconfigured connector that works today may unexpectedly stop working.\n</p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b>\n</p><p>If you have a single on-premises Exchange Server connecting to multiple Exchange Online tenants, your on-premises Exchange environment must use a unique client certificate to send to each unique Exchange Online tenant belonging to your organization. You must configure a unique Send Connector on-premises for each unique tenant in Exchange Online that you want to route on-premises traffic to: <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/exchange/mail-flow/connectors/send-connectors\" target=\"_blank\">Send connectors in Exchange Server | Microsoft Learn</a>. You should also prioritize configuring Inbound connectors of type OnPremises in Exchange Online to use certificate-based authentication, rather than IP based . For best performance, Exchange Online tenants Inbound connector’s should reference the unique client certificate dedicated for that connector path.\n</p><p>If you need to use a third-party add-on service to process email messages sent from your organization and then relay through Exchange Online, the third-party service must support a unique certificate for your organization, and the certificate domain (in Subject name or SAN) must be an accepted domain of your organization. In addition, you must update your Inbound connector of OnPremises type to use the unique certificate domain, via property TlsSenderCertificateName. An example of this scenario is your organization using a third-party CRM cloud service to send emails on behalf your organization to mailboxes of your company or other external users.

Thank you for your patience.&nbsp;</p><p>Industry trends and feedback from our customers and partners make it clear that today’s businesses demand an intelligent, integrated forms experience that spans devices which InfoPath does not provide. As announced earlier, InfoPath Client 2013 will reach the end of its extended support period on July 14, 2026 (<a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/lifecycle/products/infopath-2013\" target=\"_blank\">link</a>), and to keep an aligned experience across Microsoft products, InfoPath Forms Service will be retired from SharePoint Online. We’re sending this message to bring it to your early attention to minimize the potential impact on your organization.&nbsp;</p><p><b>Key Points:</b></p><ul><li>Major: Retirement</li><li>Timeline: Starting from July 14, 2026, Microsoft will remove InfoPath Forms Services for existing tenants. </li><li>Action: Review and assess impact</li></ul><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b><br></p><p>After July 14, 2026, users will no longer be able to use InfoPath forms in SharePoint Online.&nbsp;</p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b><br></p><p>To understand how InfoPath is used in your organization, you can run the <a href=\"https://aka.ms/assessment/infopath\" target=\"_blank\">Microsoft 365 Assessment tool</a> to scan the tenant for InfoPath usage. Using the Power BI <a href=\"https://aka.ms/assessment/infopathreport\" target=\"_blank\">InfoPath Report</a> generated by the scanner tool, you can:</p><ul><li>Identify all InfoPath Forms usage in the tenant, per site collection and site.</li><li>Evaluate the recency and volume of usage of InfoPath Forms.</li><li>Understand lists, libraries and content types that use InfoPath.</li></ul><p>We recommend communicating to the impacted site owners/teams inside your organization now, so they are aware of the coming change.\n</p><p>For scenarios where InfoPath or InfoPath Forms services are currently being used, we recommend migrating to <a href=\"https://powerapps.microsoft.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Power Apps</a>, <a href=\"https://powerautomate.microsoft.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Power Automate</a> or <a href=\"https://forms.office.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Forms</a>.  Please ensure that you allow adequate time for migration of any use of InfoPath/InfoPath Forms Services in your organization ahead of this date, as there is no migration tool provided. Additional instructions on how to migrate can be found in this <a href=\"https://aka.ms/sp-infopath-update\" target=\"_blank\">blog</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Please plan appropriately as there will not be an option to extend InfoPath Form Services beyond the InfoPath retirement date of July 14, 2026.</p>",

Thank you for your patience.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;We’re making some changes to DNS provisioning of A records for all new Accepted Domains provisioned after July 1st, 2026 (previously February 1st). Between early and late July 2026 (previously February), we will gradually switch provisioning of all A records for new Accepted Domains into the new subdomains under mx.microsoft.</p><p>We are doing this to reduce the friction of adopting DNSSEC in the long run. DNSSEC is a set of extensions to DNS that provides cryptographic verification of DNS records, preventing DNS spoofing and adversary-in-the-middle attacks to DNS.\n</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b>\n</p><p>After July 1, 2026 (previously February 1), all A records for new Accepted Domains will be provisioned into the new subdomains under mx.microsoft. July 1, 2026 (previously February 1) if not secured with DNSSEC at the domain level (ex. contoso.com), then DNS resolution will work as usual. If an Accepted Domain you add to the EAC after July 1, 2026 (previously February 1) is secured with DNSSEC, then DNSSEC will extend to the mx.microsoft DNS record automatically and you will get the benefits of DNSSEC without having to take any further action. Any issues with DNSSEC can be addressed by disabling DNSSEC for the Accepted Domain (ex. contoso.com) via your DNS provider.</p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b>\n</p><p>If you have any automation in place, for example in workflows for Domain Setup, for MX record creation that expects A records for newly provisioned Accepted Domains to be provisioned in mail.protection.outlook.com, this automation needs to be updated by July 1, 2026 (previously February 1) to use List serviceConfigurationRecords Graph API (<a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/graph/api/domain-list-serviceconfigurationrecords?view=graph-rest-1.0&amp;tabs=http\" target=\"_blank\">List serviceConfigurationRecords</a>). Use List serviceConfigurationRecords to retrieve the mailExchange value for your MX record. After July 1, 2026 (previously February 1), List serviceConfigurationRecords Graph API will be the only source of truth for your Accepted Domains’ MX record value. You will not be able to rely on the Accepted Domain’s A record being provisioned in mail.protection.outlook.com after July 1, 2026 (previously February 1).</p><p>If you are using automation that expects the record to end with mail.protection.outlook.com, when you add a new Accepted Domain to the Exchange Admin Center after July 1, 2026 (previously February 1), mail flow may not work upon initial configuration and you will have to update your MX record to match what the Exchange Admin Center says for the domain or use the mailExchange value returned by List serviceConfigurationRecords Graph API.\n</p><p>If you expect this change to cause any issues for your organization, please share that feedback. \n</p><p><br></p>",

      "Content": "<p>Updated January 29, 2026: We are updating this post as a reminder. Upcoming SharePoint Online changes may impact your organization. Please review the below.</p><p>We are implementing the following changes to custom scripting and classic publishing in SharePoint Online.</p><p><b>1. Disablement of custom scripting</b></p><p>Custom scripting will be disabled by default (setting DenyAddAndCustomizePages to 1 or $true) for sites created with the following templates:</p><ul><li>BLANKINTERNETCONTAINER#0 = Classic Publishing Portal Site\n</li><li>CMSPUBLISHING#0 = Classic Publishing Site\n</li><li>BLANKINTERNET#0 = Classic Publishing Site Blank</li><li>CSPCONTAINER#0 = SharePoint Embedded Site</li></ul><p>NOTE:\n</p><ul><li>Existing classic publishing sites created with the templates listed above will have custom scripting disabled by default. \n</li><li>Disabling custom scripting does not affect the execution of scripts that have already been added to a site or page.</li></ul><p>Refer to <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/sharepoint/security-considerations-of-allowing-custom-script\" target=\"_blank\">this documentation</a> to learn more about the security considerations of ungoverned scripting.</p><p><b>2. Ability to set site property bag valued without requiring custom scripting enablement.</b></p><p>Users no longer need to set DenyAddAndCustomizePages to $false or 0 (i.e. enable custom scripting) in a site to manage site property bag values. We have introduced a new AllowWebPropertyBagUpdateWhenDenyAddAndCustomizePagesIsEnabled setting at the site level and at the tenant level to allow adding/managing site property bag values. Please see documentation here for <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/module/sharepoint-online/set-spotenant?view=sharepoint-ps#-allowwebpropertybagupdatewhendenyaddandcustomizepagesisenabled\" target=\"_blank\">tenant level setting</a>&nbsp;and here for <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/module/sharepoint-online/set-sposite?view=sharepoint-ps#-allowwebpropertybagupdatewhendenyaddandcustomizepagesisenabled\" target=\"_blank\">the site level setting.</a>&nbsp;</p><p><b>3. Classic publishing sites creation and feature activation changes</b></p><p>Users will no longer be able to create new classic publishing related site collections or activate publishing features in existing site collections. This applies to both UX and API interactions.</p><p>Sites collections with the following templates cannot be created:</p><ul><li>BLANKINTERNETCONTAINER#0 = Publishing Portal Site\n</li><li>CMSPUBLISHING#0 = Publishing Site\n</li><li>BLANKINTERNET#0 = Publishing Site Blank\n</li><li>ENTERWIKI#0 = Enterprise Wiki\n</li><li>SRCHCEN#0 = Enterprise Search Center\n</li><li>SPSSITES#0 = Site Directory\n</li><li>SPSNHOME#0 = News Home Site\n</li><li>PRODUCTCATALOG#0 = Product Catalog\n</li><li>SPSREPORTCENTER#0 = Report Center\n</li><li>SPSTOPIC#0 = Topic Area Template</li></ul><p style=\"\">Existing classic publishing enabled site collections are unaffected and can continue regular usage, including creation of sub sites.</p><p><b>When this will happen</b></p><p>Both changes, the extended custom scripting governance and the new classic publishing restrictions, will take effect starting <b>September 15, 2025</b>.</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization</b><br></p><ul><li>When custom scripting is disabled in classic publishing sites, users will no longer be able to use script editor web parts, create custom master pages or page layouts, and utilize several other features. More details on features affected when custom scripting is disabled can be viewed in <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepoint/allow-or-prevent-custom-script#features-affected-when-custom-script-is-blocked\" target=\"_blank\">this documentation</a>.</li></ul><p>\n</p><ul><li>With the change to stop the creation of new classic publishing site collections and publishing feature activation, SharePoint admins will no longer be able to create new classic publishing enabled site collections or enable publishing features at site collection level.</li></ul><p><b>What you need to do to prepare</b></p><p>We recommend taking the following actions to prepare for these upcoming changes.</p><p>\n</p><p>1.\tInform owners of the classic publishing sites in your organization of these upcoming changes. Promote switching to use of Modern sites. Refer to <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/sharepoint/dev/transform/modernize-guidance\" target=\"_blank\">this guide</a>.</p><p>2. The following tenant-level opt-out operation, used to allow custom scripting changes in classic publishing sites, will be retired starting <b>March 15, 2026.</b> Please ensure appropriate actions are taken ahead of this change.</p><p><code>Set-SPOTenant -DelayDenyAddAndCustomizePagesEnforcementOnClassicPublishingSites $true</code></p><p>3. Customers may still temporarily opt out of custom scripting enforcement for a specific site (any template) with tenant admin approval. This opt-out is effective for 24 hours&nbsp;and can be enabled using the following PowerShell command:</p><p><code>Set-SPOSite &lt;SiteURL&gt;&nbsp;<siteurl>-DenyAddAndCustomizePages $false</siteurl></code></p><p>4.\tIf you need to allow the creation of new classic publishing site collections or enable publishing feature activations, use the following PowerShell command set the flag to allow.</p><p><code>Set-SPOTenant -AllowClassicPublishingSiteCreation $true</code></p><p>NOTE: </p><ul><li>You need to install the latest (<a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=35588&amp;msockid=1928b372f07766b62b63a78cf1426719\" target=\"_blank\">16.0.26211.12010</a> or higher) SharePoint Online Management Shell in order to run the commands above.</li><li>The DelayDenyAddAndCustomizePagesEnforcementOnClassicPublishingSites command is scheduled to end starting on <b>March 15, 2026,</b> while all other commands are expected to remain functional beyond that date.&nbsp;</li></ul><p><b>Compliance considerations</b></p><p><b>\n</b></p><p>There is no impact or change to compliance.</p><p><b>Referenced content</b>\n</p><p><a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepoint/security-considerations-of-allowing-custom-script\" target=\"_blank\">Security considerations of allowing custom script - SharePoint in Microsoft 365 | Microsoft Learn</a></p><p><a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepoint/allow-or-prevent-custom-script\" target=\"_blank\">Allow or prevent custom script - SharePoint in Microsoft 365 | Microsoft Learn</a></p><p><a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepoint/dev/transform/modernize-guidance\" target=\"_blank\">SharePoint modernization guidance | Microsoft Learn</a></p><p><br></p><p>\n</p><p>\n</p><p>\n</p><p></p><p></p>",

      "Content": "<p>Updated January 20, 2026: We’ve updated how Teams meeting join links appear in meeting invites. As part of the broader rollout of the new, shorter meeting URL format, meeting invites now display the full join link directly instead of a labeled “Join the meeting now” hyperlink. This improves link consistency, reliability across clients and email applications, and makes copying and sharing the link easier. This update does not change meeting functionality or attendee experience. Existing Teams and Outlook clients continue to support the new link format.</p><p>Please note that information about meeting link expiry changes related to this rollout has been added.</p><p>We are reducing the length of Microsoft Teams meeting URLs for easier sharing. This rollout applies to all Microsoft Teams platforms (Teams for iOS, Android, Mac, Teams devices, desktop, and web).</p><p>This message is associated with Microsoft 365 Roadmap ID <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?filters=&amp;searchterms=381953\" target=\"_blank\">381953</a>.\n</p><p><b>When this will happen:</b>\n</p><p>Targeted Release: We will begin rolling out mid-February 2025 (previously mid-January) and expect to complete by late February 2025 (previously late January). Only Meet Now use cases (except Meet Now in chats and channels) will be affected in this timeframe. There will be no impact on the scheduled meetings in this phase.</p><p>General Availability (Worldwide, GCC): We will begin rolling out January 2026 (previously mid-May 2025) and expect to complete by end of January 2026 (previously late May 2025).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>General Availability (GCC High, DoD):&nbsp; We will begin rolling out February 2026 (previously early August 2025) and expect to complete by end of February 2026 (previously late October 2025).</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b>\n</p><p>The new URL syntax is: https://teams.microsoft.com/meet/&lt;meeting_id&gt;?p=&lt;HashedPasscode&gt; \n</p><p>To make meeting URL shorter, we are removing several parameters such as tenant ID, conversation ID etc. This change serves two main goals: 1) improving usability of URL during sharing and 2) making the URL more secure and less susceptible to malicious attacks. \n</p><p>Here are some details about how meeting links work and when they expire: \n</p><ol><li>In case the meeting organizer gets removed from the tenant, the links to the meetings scheduled by them automatically expire. \n</li><li>&nbsp;MeetNow meetings expire 60 days after creation. Learn more about expiration timelines for different types of meetings. \n</li></ol><p>With the Short Meeting URL release, expiration limit will be applied to all newly created links. \n</p><p>Once the change to Short Meeting URL is released, all newly created meetings will expire as described in the documentation: 60 days after meeting ends for scheduled meetings and 60 days after creation for MeetNow meetings. Once this expiry period is over, in case someone clicks the link (e.g. outside of Teams app OR in the meeting details inside Teams calendar section), they will be unable to join the meeting.</p><p>Note: Old links created before short meeting URL release will continue working as it previously was (user will be able to join even after the documented expiry limits).</p><p>The reason why we are making this change is simple: security is our topmost priority. Maintaining a high security level is essential to protect sensitive data, prevent financial losses, ensure business continuity, and meet compliance and legal obligations. It is a critical aspect of modern digital life and business operations. This adjustment is designed to enhance the security of Teams meeting links, thereby better safeguarding the customer tenant. We want to be on par with modern security standards, that’s why the new behavior is a step in the right direction that we must take. It’s not possible to keep the current behavior. If you think it breaks some of your business processes, please leave comment to the MC post and describe your case there. \n</p><p>Recommendations in case the meeting link has expired:  \n</p><p>For meeting organizer: We recommend scheduling a new meeting. If the meeting organizer got removed from the tenant someone else should reschedule their meetings from scratch. \n</p><p>For participant: Please reach out to the meeting organizer and ask them to reschedule the meeting or send you an updated link.</p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b>\n</p><p>You may want to check if you have any integrations that use parameters from URL. After the rollout, the URL will only contain the meeting ID. Parameters such as tenant ID, organizer ID, conversation ID and message ID will not be in the URL. \n</p><p>You may inform meeting organizers from your tenant who use expired meeting links, or you may want to make a tenant-wide announcement about this change. \n</p><p>This rollout will happen automatically by the specified date with no admin action required. You may want to notify your users about this change and update any relevant documentation as appropriate.</p>",

      "Content": "<p>Updated January 12, 2026: We have updated the content. Thank you for your patience.</p><p>In response to customer feedback, we are introducing enhanced flexibility, greater scalability, and streamlined compliance management for private channels in Microsoft Teams.\n</p><p>Note: It is important for compliance managers to review and take appropriate action before migration starts for these changes to private channels. \n</p><p><b>What's changing?</b></p><p>Private channels will transition use a channel mailbox instead of individual user mailboxes. \n</p><p>Organizations with compliance policies (retention, legal hold, data loss prevention, or eDiscovery) for private channels must review these policies and must apply policies to the Microsoft 365 group for the channel’s team before migration begins to ensure continuity of the policy for a private channel.  Existing policies will continue to apply to user mailboxes; post-migration, new data will be governed by policies on the group. Note that policies applied to the team’s group can apply to all channels in the team.\n</p><p>After the transition to updated private channels in your organization, private channels will be updated as follows.\n</p><ol><li>Private channels are no longer limited to 30 per team. Instead, private channels can be added up to the limit of 1000 total channels per team.\n</li><li>Private channels can now have up to 5000 members, instead of 250.\n</li><li>Meetings can now be scheduled in private channels.\n</li><li>Compliance policies for private channels are part of the team’s group policies instead of the individual user level.\n</li></ol><p>The migration of private channels will begin in early October 2025 and continue through February 2026. During this period, private channels will continue to operate normally. Admins and compliance managers should complete any required policy changes by October 2025, before the migration begins. Changes to private channel limits and meeting scheduling will follow in early March 2026.</p><p>As part of this change, newly created private channels will not be created with a document library by default; the root folder is used as a default location for any new files.</p>\n</p><p><b>When this will happen:</b>\n</p><p>General Availability (Worldwide): We will begin rolling out private channel migration early October 2025 (previously late September) and expect to complete by February 2026. Updated channel limits and meeting scheduling will complete in March 2026.</p><p><b>Action required by compliance managers and admins</b></p><ol><li>Purview eDiscovery and Legal Hold</li>\n<p></p><p>With this change, private channel data will move from user mailboxes to the group mailbox, aligning with how shared channels data is stored. Previously, legal holds were applied to user mailboxes since private channel data resided in each member’s mailbox. Post-migration, the latest version of private channel message data from each user’s mailbox is moved to the private channel’s group mailbox. Message edits and deleted messages will not be copied into the group mailbox.\n</p><p>Note: For users on hold, copies of message edits and deleted messages will remain in the user’s preserved library folder until the hold expires, while the latest version of private channel message data from each user’s mailbox is copied to the private channel’s group mailbox. \n</p><p>Before migration\n</p><p>If a legal hold exists for a private channel, admins must also apply the policy to the team’s group, in addition to the policy already applied to users’ mailboxes, in order for a hold to apply to new data generated and stored in the private channel’s mailbox. Note that policies applied to the team’s group can apply to all channels in the team.\n</p><p><img src=\"https://cxcs.microsoft.net/file/ccp/en-us/752d2d97-48d7-4491-a3e7-ecc866373a44  \" width=\"400\" height=\"\"></p><p>Screenshot 1: Setting up a new hold in Microsoft Purview compliance portal.\n</p><p>After migration\n</p><p>For existing holds admins will need to ensure that the hold is applied to the user mailbox as well as the new group mailbox, in order for a hold to apply to existing and new message data. Any new legal holds will need to be applied to the group.\n</p><p>For complete eDiscovery, include both the private channel’s users’ mailboxes and the team’s group mailbox to retrieve pre-migration messages, message history, and post-migration new content.\n</p><p><img src=\"https://cxcs.microsoft.net/file/ccp/en-us/0de1f667-c352-400b-8a94-57237676a30d  \" width=\"400\" height=\"\"></p><p>Screenshot 2: Configuring an eDiscovery search in Microsoft Purview compliance portal.\n</p><li>Purview Data Loss Prevention (DLP)</li> \n<p></p><p>With this change, private channel messages will be included as a part of the DLP policy scoped to the private channel’s team’s group, as opposed to the user mailbox. \n</p><p>Before migration\n</p><p>Admins must modify the “Teams chat and channel messages” policy for private channels to add the team’s group containing the private channel, in addition to the user mailbox, in order to include new private channel messages in a policy. Note that policies applied to the team’s group can apply to all channels in the team.\n</p><p>After migration\n</p><p>Ensure that “Teams chat and channel messages” policy for private channels is scoped to the team’s group containing the private channel. \n</p><p><img src=\"https://cxcs.microsoft.net/file/ccp/en-us/96d2a6b8-fdf0-402c-8475-d8631fe4ae2b \" width=\"400\" height=\"\"></p><p>Screenshot 3: Configuring a data loss prevention policy in Microsoft Purview compliance portal.\n</p><li>Purview Retention Policy</li>\n<p></p><p>After this change, creation of new private channel-specific policies will not be possible in the Purview portal. Instead, “Teams channel messages” policies applied to the team’s group will now include private channels. Existing private channel policies will remain in effect and preserve all held message data in user mailboxes. Editing of existing policies will not be supported but policies can be removed.\n</p><p>Before migration\n</p><p>Apply current private channel retention policies (previously on user mailboxes) to Teams channel messages to include the team’s group, in order to include new private channel messages in a policy.

      "Content": "<p>Updated January 23, 2026: We have updated the timeline. Thank you for your patience.</p><p><b>Introduction</b></p><p>We hear your feedback about ways we can improve the notifications experience in Viva Engage. It's always a fine balance between ensuring your users are notified of relevant content without notifications feeling too overwhelming or noisy. In response to your feedback, we're rolling out an intelligent notifications experience. Specifically, this change will improve how <i>Community Announcement</i> notifications are delivered. This smarter delivery approach optimizes notifications delivery based on a user’s engagement behavior, helping to reduce notifications fatigue while ensuring timely visibility of announcements.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><b>When this will happen</b><b></b></p><p><b>General Availability (Worldwide): </b>We will begin rolling out this change in mid-September 2025 and expect the rollout to reach GA (General Availability) by February 6, 2026 (previously end of January).</p>\n\n<p><b>How this affects your organization</b>\n</p><p>Previously, when an admin created a new Community Announcement, this would send a notification in Teams and Mobile Push immediately, followed by an email notification two hours later if the announcement was not opened already in Teams and/or Mobile Push.&nbsp;\nWith this new update:\n</p><ul>\n<li>Users will now receive the notification in <b>one channel only</b>—either Teams, Mobile Push, or Email. This notification channel may differ by user and is selected based on where a user has engaged with Engage notifications most frequently in the past 30 days.&nbsp;</li><li>If the announcement is not opened within two hours in the first notification channel, a <b>secondary notification channel</b> will be sent, also determined by where a user engages with Engage notifications most frequently.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>We will continue to respect all user notification preferences and settings where applicable. If a notification channel is disabled or the app is not installed, it will not be selected as a potential notification channel for the Community Announcement delivery.</p><p>Note that this change applies only to<b> regular Community Announcements in Viva Engage</b> and does not affect the \"immediate\" Community Announcement feature (where admins can still select the checkbox to send emails immediately —this functionality remains unchanged).</p><p><b>Can I still notify Community users via email immediately (along with other notification channels)?&nbsp;</b></p><p>Yes! In Viva Engage, we offer an option to send an “immediate” Community Announcement. With this feature, Community admins can choose to send email notifications immediately after posting a Community Announcement, even if a user has opted out of receiving emails. All other notification channels will also send immediately along with email, including Teams and Mobile Push. Therefore, we recommend admins to use this feature when there is a Community Announcement that requires immediate attention from users.&nbsp;</p><p>Community Admins can find this “immediate” Community Announcement option by firstly navigating to the announcement publisher and selecting the hyperlinked <b><i>“option to send emails immediately” </i></b>at the bottom of the publisher. Upon clicking this option, an additional pop-up box will open called <i><b>“Immediate email delivery”</b></i>. By selecting this checkbox, this will ensure that all three notification channels – Email, Teams, and Mobile Push – will send to customers immediately after a Community Announcement is made.&nbsp;</p><p><b>\n&nbsp;What you can do to prepare</b>\n</p><p>No admin action is required. However, we recommend:\n</p><ul>\n<li>Informing your users about the new notifications change to reduce confusion</li>\n<li>Monitoring user feedback and engagement with <i>Community Announcements' notifications delivery</i></li>\n<li>Reviewing internal communication strategies to align with the new notification's behavior</li></ul><p></p><p></p>\n<table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n<tbody><tr><th>Compliance Area</th><th>Explanation</th></tr>\n<tr><td>Does the change alter how existing customer data is processed, stored, or accessed?</td><td>Yes. Notification delivery logic now uses user behavior data (last 30 days of notification engagement) to determine delivery channels. This data is used to personalize delivery but is not stored permanently.</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Does the change introduce or significantly modify AI/ML or agent capabilities that interact with or provide access to customer data?</td><td>Yes. The system uses behavioral data to determine the most effective notification channel, which is a form of machine learning-based personalization.</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Does the change provide a new way of communicating between users, tenants, or subscriptions?</td><td>Yes. The change modifies how users receive communications (Community Announcements) by introducing a dynamic, behavior-based delivery method.</td></tr>\n</tbody></table>",

      "Content": "<p>We’re improving SharePoint Online security via Content Security Policy (CSP) enforcement. Currently CSP is applied in reporting mode but as of March 1, 2026, the Content Security Policy will be enforced which will prevent the loading of script (e.g. JavaScript) from non-allowed sources. This message center post replaces MC1055557 (April 2024).</p><p>This change is associated with Microsoft 365 Roadmap ID: <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?id=485797\" target=\"_blank\">485797</a></p><p><b>When this will happen:</b></p><p>This will be implemented starting March 1, 2026.</p><p>\n</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b></p><p>If your organization extended SharePoint Online using SPFx then the created custom SPFx solutions could potentially load scripts from locations which are not allowed. In most cases SPFx solutions use and load script from allowed locations, but that’s not always the case. Any script from a not allowed location will be blocked, the same applies for any inline script usage. SPFx solutions whose script is getting blocked will not function anymore as designed, impacting business scenarios depending on those solutions.\n</p><p>To prevent solutions from breaking there you need to:\n</p><ol><li>Ensure all used script locations are trusted script sources. This can be done without updating the SPFx solution\n</li><li>Move all inline script to script files which can then be defined as trusted source. <b>This will require updating the SPFx solution!\n</b></li></ol><p>If you need more time to review your SPFx solutions, there’s an option to postpone CSP enforcement by 90 days via below SPO Management Shell PowerShell cmdlet.\n</p><p><code>Set-SPOTenant -DelayContentSecurityPolicyEnforcement $true</code>\n</p><p>Note:\n</p><p>This option will be available in the SPO Management Shell version 16.0.26712.12000 (November 2025) or higher.\n</p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b></p><p>In addition to the default CSP settings, SharePoint Online will add locations listed in the Trusted Script Sources area of the SharePoint Online Admin Center as valid locations for CSP, thus enabling script loading from those locations. To add an entry, in a browser, go to the Trusted Script Sources via SharePoint Online Admin Center &gt; Advanced &gt; Script sources.\n</p><p><img src=\"https://cxcs.microsoft.net/file/ccp/en-us/65be05c0-aa60-4cd8-8c3d-cbf18cddbb73 \" width=\"400\" height=\"\"></p><p>To understand which script location to add there are two options. First option is testing your SPFx solutions with the browser dev tools console open. As CSP is in reporting mode until March 1, 2026, there will be messages indicating script that will be blocked once CSP is enforced. These messages start with “Loading the script '&lt;path to script&gt;' violates the following…” or “Executing inline script violates the following Content Security Policy directive…”. \n</p><p>Whenever the browser logs a CSP violation, that violation is also logged to <a href=\"https://purview.microsoft.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Microsoft Purview</a>. In the browser, navigate to the Audit solution in Microsoft Purview from the Microsoft 365 Admin Center. From the Search page, search for the Activity - friendly names value Violated Content Security Policy, or the Activity - operation names value ViolatedContentSecurityPolicy:\n</p><p><img src=\"https://cxcs.microsoft.net/file/ccp/en-us/ece7b2ac-44f9-4abe-b95f-426e20ab77bf \" width=\"400\" height=\"\"></p><p>Selecting a search result opens the side panel with the audit details. Take note of the following properties:</p><ul><li><b>DocumentUrl:</b> This indicates the page in the SharePoint Online site where the CSP violation occurred.</li><li><b>BlockedUrl:</b> This indicates the URL of the script that violated the CSP configuration or contains “inline” when the violation came from loading inline script\n</li></ul><p><img src=\"https://cxcs.microsoft.net/file/ccp/en-us/1818988a-08d8-4e41-802e-9abdc94ec2c5 \" width=\"400\" height=\"\"></p><p><b><u>Important\n</u></b></p><p>In the case of inline script, the remediation requires updating the SPFx solution by moving inline script into a separate script file, which then can be added as a trusted source.\n</p><p>Learn more: <a href=\"https://aka.ms/spfx/csp\" target=\"_blank\">Support for Content Security Policy (CSP) in SharePoint Online</a>&nbsp;</p>",

Exact revised date will be shared in a future update. The service shutdown date remains unchanged. Admins should NOT turn off the add-in on December 8, 2025 (or take any other action) so that users can continue using the add-in until the revised removal date and the service shutdown.

Thank you for your patience.&nbsp;</p><p><b>When this will happen:&nbsp;</b>Updated Rollout Schedule for iPhone and iPad</p><p>The first phase of this change is in-product notifications in the M365 Copilot app to encourage users who are editing documents to install the Word, PowerPoint, Excel apps. Users who try to browse files or manage their OneDrive libraries will be promoted to install the OneDrive app. This in-app notification will roll out to TestFlight users at the end of August and become generally available the week of September 15, 2025. This is a modification from the initial post to allow our enterprise customers more time to prepare.</p><p>The second phase of this change updates the Word, PowerPoint and Excel functionality in the Microsoft 365 Copilot app with previewers that will be made available to TestFlight users only in October and GA rollout will begin mid-October 2025. This will be a gradual, phased rollout that will take about 4 weeks or so to reach 100% of customers. These changes only apply to iPhone for now, iPad will see similar changes with a start of TestFlight in early November, and the start of the GA rollout in mid November. For iPad we will have a phased rollout that gradually ramps up to 100% of GA in about 4 weeks time.</p><p>To get early builds and test out features before GA dates – you will need to join the iOS TestFlight program for the Microsoft 365 Copilot app.  There are a limited number of seats available in the iOS TestFlight program. We periodically remove inactive users (those who have not updated their build) to make space for others. If you are unable to join because the program is full, please check back later, or contact your Microsoft Support representative.

Users will continue to be able to view files and use Copilot Chat to get deeper analysis and insights on their content. If a user needs to edit, the M365 Copilot app will transition to the standalone Word, Excel, or PowerPoint apps.

This message serves as a reminder as we begin a broader rollout of the feature announced in 2023.</p><p>\n</p><p><b>When this will happen:</b></p><p>Ongoing rollout.&nbsp;</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b></p><p>When rolled out, users within your organization will be able to directly initiate a Teams Premium trial. These self-service trial licenses will be a part of your Microsoft organizational tenant, and you will be able to manage these licenses like other Microsoft subscriptions. You will be able to cancel these trial licenses at any time.</p><p>You will also be able to fully control whether trials are converted to paid subscriptions. Users will not need to input payment information when signing up. If a user would like to convert to a paid license, they must work with you directly to do so as there is no auto-renew functionality for these trials. If a user isn’t upgraded to a paid subscription, all services included in their Microsoft Teams Premium will end, and the user may lose read only access to data generated by Teams Premium, stored in Microsoft Teams, OneDrive, and SharePoint.<br></p><p>Users in tenants where self-service trials are disabled may still see the “Get Premium” prompt when accessing features that require a premium license. This is expected behavior and helps signal user interest to admins. It can also help identify which users in your organization may need a Teams Premium license, allowing you to better manage and allocate your available licenses.&nbsp; To reduce confusion and prevent users from submitting license requests, admins can customize the license request flow. Instead of showing the default request form, they can configure a custom message explaining that license requests are not supported in their organization. For setup instructions, see <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/commerce/licenses/manage-license-requests?view=o365-worldwide#use-your-own-request-process\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); font-family: sans-serif; font-weight: 400;\">Use your own request process – Microsoft Learn</a>.</p><p>Microsoft Teams Premium helps make your Teams meetings more intelligent, protected, and engaging.

This new integration leverages DLM features to provide an additional control for Adaptive protection that automatically preserves items deleted by a user with an elevated risk level, so items can be restored if needed.</p><p>This message is associated with Microsoft 365 Roadmap ID <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?filters=&amp;searchterms=392839\" target=\"_blank\">392839</a>.\n</p><p><b>When this will happen:</b>\n</p><p>Public preview: We will begin rolling out in late June 2024 (previously early May) and expect to complete by late July 2024 (previously mid-July).\n</p><p>General Availability:&nbsp; We will begin rolling out late June 2026 (previously early February 2026) and expect to complete by late June 2026 (previously early February 2026).</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b>\n</p><p>After the rollout, and after you enable Adaptive protection for your tenant, the retention label and auto-apply policy for data lifecycle management will be automatically created for you. This policy will automatically include elevated risk users identified by Microsoft Purview | Insider Risk Management solution. If these users delete content from Microsoft SharePoint, Microsoft OneDrive, or Microsoft Exchange, a retention label is automatically applied to that content to retain it for 120 days. Retention labels are automatically applied to unlabeled content deleted by these users. When these users are no longer at the elevated risk level, they are automatically removed from the DLM policy, and the system will no longer keep a copy of content they delete. Any content copies previously retained when the user had an elevated risk level will be kept for the 120 days as specified by the retention label.\n</p><p>Unlike other retention labeling scenarios, users do not see the retention label, and you do not need to create or manage the retention label or policy. At this time, you can't change the retention period or assign different policies based on the different risk levels, or for different locations. The single retention label and auto-labeling policy for your tenant is not visible in the Microsoft Purview compliance portal.</p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b>\n</p><p>Learn more: <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/purview/retention#dynamically-mitigate-the-risk-of-accidental-or-malicious-deletes\" target=\"_blank\">Learn about retention policies &amp; labels to retain or delete | Microsoft Learn</a>\n</p><p>If you're using Adaptive protection and want to automatically retain content deleted by elevated risk users, follow these steps to turn on this new integration.\n</p><ol><li>Sign in to the <a href=\"https://compliance.microsoft.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Microsoft Purview compliance portal</a>.\n</li><li>Navigate to <i>Data lifecycle management &gt; Microsoft 365 &gt; Adaptive protection settings</i> in the top right corner.\n</li><li>Turn the setting ON and select <i>Save</i>.\n</li></ol><p>\n</p><p><img src=\"https://cxcs.microsoft.net/file/messagecenter/en-us/fe6a20ed-77ce-44ce-b862-bc7f4b78b93e\" style=\"width: 400px;\" alt=\"admin settings\">\n</p><p><img src=\"https://cxcs.microsoft.net/file/messagecenter/en-us/521b359c-13a9-41ef-ad96-215789a32eb3\" style=\"width: 400px;\" alt=\"admin settings\">\n</p><p>If you’re not using Adaptive protection already, turn on Adaptive protection and the new feature will be enabled along with Adaptive protection.\n</p><p>This rollout will happen automatically by the specified date with no admin action required before the rollout.

This change helps protect your organization from unauthorized access and aligns with industry best practices for identity protection.\n</p><p>This effort is part of Microsoft’s commitment to enhance security for all customers and follows <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/identity/authentication/concept-mandatory-multifactor-authentication?tabs=dotnet#phase-1-applications\" target=\"_blank\">Azure’s Phase 1 rollout</a> completed last year. Phase 2 enforcement ensures that all Azure clients - including CLI, PowerShell, SDKs, and REST APIs - are protected against unauthorized access.\n</p><p><b>When this will happen</b></p><p>Phase 2 enforcement will begin rolling out on  October 1, 2025, and will be applied gradually across tenants. Customers may postpone enforcement until July 2026 if additional time is needed to become compliant.</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization</b></p><p>Users will be required to set up MFA before performing Azure resource management actions (via Azure CLI, PowerShell, Mobile App, Identity SDK, IaC tools, or REST APIs).\n</p><p>Enforcement applies to all Azure tenants in the public cloud and all users. This includes automation and scripts using user identities (instead of application IDs).

Thank you for your patience.</p><p>In 2018, <a href=\"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/exchange-team-blog/upcoming-changes-to-exchange-web-services-ews-api-for-office-365/ba-p/608055\" target=\"_blank\">we announced</a> that we were no longer making feature updates to Exchange Web Services (EWS) in Exchange Online, and we advised developers to move to Microsoft Graph. </p><p>In September 2023, we announced that on October 1, 2026, we will start blocking EWS requests to Exchange Online. \n</p><p>\n</p><p>We are now less than 18 months from October 1, 2026. We have made progress on closing several parity gaps with more changes in development to be released in the coming quarters. Please refer to <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/exchange/clients-and-mobile-in-exchange-online/deprecation-of-ews-exchange-online\" target=\"_blank\">Deprecation of Exchange Web Services in Exchange Online</a> for up-to-date guidance and roadmap information.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>If you haven't already, start the process of working with your application development organization and your application vendors to migrate active EWS applications on your tenant to the Graph API.&nbsp;</p><p>\n</p><p><b>When this will happen:</b></p><p>October 1, 2026</p><p><b>How this affects your organization:</b></p><p>While the EWS components of the service will continue to receive security updates and certain non-security updates, product design and features will remain unchanged. This change also applies to the EWS SDKs for Java and .NET, as well.\n</p><p>Despite this announcement, EWS is still available and supported for use in production environments. But we strongly suggest migrating to Microsoft Graph to access Exchange Online data and gain access to the latest features and functionality.\n</p><p>Today’s update and the retirement of EWS apply only to Microsoft 365 and Exchange Online (all environments); there are no changes to EWS in Exchange Server. Further, the changes in Exchange Online do not affect Outlook for Windows or Mac, Teams, or any other Microsoft product.</p><p>In our original blog post, we said this change would affect only third-party (non-Microsoft) applications.<b> We have expanded our effort and are now also removing EWS dependencies from Microsoft apps and services, and we’re going to complete that work well before October 2026</b>.

We will not provide APIs for programmatically creating, reading, updating and deleting public folders after October 2026 (also see <a href=\"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/exchange/security-related-updates-in-exchange-online/4303525\" target=\"_blank\">Security Related Updates in Exchange Online</a>).&nbsp;</li></ul><div><br></div><p>We know there are other gaps not listed above, and we continue to work on closing them, but it’s possible some functionality will not make it to Microsoft Graph.

Thank you for your patience.</p><p>When an external network participant is invited to join a Microsoft Viva Engage external network, they receive an invitation email with an option to accept. Before this configuration change, all invited external users receive community conversations and emails, even if their invitation is in a pending or inactive state, allowing them to receive updates without completing registration. An E3/E5 license is required to use this feature.\n</p><p>After this change, pending or inactive users will no longer receive community conversations or emails unless they accept the invitation and complete the registration process. This change prioritizes active engagement, ensuring only registered users access conversation updates and reducing the volume of emails sent to non-registered users. External users who have activated their accounts will receive conversations and community emails.\n</p><p>We will begin rolling out this change early December 2024 and expected to complete by early January 2025.
