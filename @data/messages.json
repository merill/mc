To set up bookable desks, admins must associate these devices to a workspace account through the Teams Rooms Pro Management portal. Similarly, to set up <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/rooms/bring-your-own-device\" target=\"_blank\">BYOD rooms</a> (rooms without Microsoft Teams Rooms that are equipped with devices such as a speaker puck or other peripherals), admins must associate these devices to a room account through the Teams Rooms Pro Management portal. Finally, in order for a user’s work location to be updated to a specific building, an admin must onboard their buildings<a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/places/get-started/quick-setup-buildings-floors?branch=main\" target=\"_blank\">&nbsp;</a>and parent the workspace or room resource account to the buildings.</p><p>After these steps are complete, admins have the <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/teams/new-csteamsworklocationdetectionpolicy?view=teams-ps\" target=\"_blank\">option to opt-in</a> for automatic location updates. This can be enabled at a tenant level or for a specific user group. Once admins have enabled this feature, users will have the opportunity to opt-in. They can do so in Teams under <i>Settings &gt; Privacy</i>. After users have opted-in, their work location will automatically update to a specific building when they connect to a bookable desk or BYOD room. Note that if a workspace or room resource account does not have a building, the user's work location will automatically update to “In the office” upon plug-in rather than update to the specific building</p><p>To facilitate discovery of this feature, after tenant opt-in, the following banner will be shown the first time a user plugs into a bookable desk or BYOD room.</p><p><span style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 0);\"> \n</span></p><p><img src=\"https://img-prod-cms-rt-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/cms/api/am/imageFileData/RW1qrTr?ver=f226\" style=\"width: 550px;\"><br></p><p>Once a user enables automatic location updates, the following banner will be displayed only once for the user’s convenience and confirmation that the location update was successful on their first subsequent plug-in to bookable desks or BYOD room.</p><p><img src=\"https://img-prod-cms-rt-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/cms/api/am/imageFileData/RW1qiPN?ver=00da\" style=\"width: 550px;\"><span style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 0);\"><br></span></p><p><span style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 0);\"> \n</span></p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b>\n</p><p>To prepare for this feature, we strongly recommend communicating this new feature to your users and admin team and sharing instructions if needed.

Users start in the combined <i>Chat </i>view but can opt to keep chat separate from teams and channels like before.\n</p><p>In the Chat view, users will see these sections (in order):\n</p><ol><li><i>Favorites </i>containing any previously pinned chats and channels\n</li><li><i>Chats </i>sorted by most recent\n</li><li><i>Teams and channels</i>, organized in same order as in the <i>Teams </i>view\n</li></ol><p>Also, users can create custom sections to organize projects and topics that can include individual, group, and meeting chats, as well as channels. \n</p><p><i>Favorites, Chats, </i>and <i>Teams and channels </i>in one list in Teams for Windows: \n</p><p><img src=\"https://img-prod-cms-rt-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/cms/api/am/imageFileData/RW1qdz3?ver=aa52\" style=\"width: 400px;\" alt=\"user controls\">\n</p><p><i>Favorites, Chats, </i>and <i>Teams </i>and <i>channels </i>in one list in Teams for iOS (also available for Android):\n</p><p><img src=\"https://img-prod-cms-rt-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/cms/api/am/imageFileData/RW1qiPQ?ver=c363\" style=\"width: 250px;\" alt=\"user controls\">\n</p><p>New filters for <i>Unread, Chat, Channels, Meetings</i> and more help users focus on relevant conversation in their list. Filters persist until turned off.\n</p><p>The new @mention view gathers all personal @mentions into one interactive list. Users can quickly access messages with @mentions across chats, channels, and meetings.\n</p><p><i>Customizing the experience</i>\n</p><p>Users can tailor their chat and channels experience in Teams <i>Settings</i>. Users can choose to keep chat, teams, and channels combined in <i>Chat </i>(default) or switch to separate <i>Chat </i>and <i>Teams </i>views. In the combined <i>Chat </i>view, message previews are off by default to simplify the list. Users can turn on message previews in <i>Settings</i>.\n</p><p>When using the separate <i>Chat</i> and <i>Teams </i>views, users can still use the new filters and the @mentions view to triage and organize topics with custom sections.</p><p>\n</p><p><i>Starting the new experience</i>\n</p><p>A self-service guided onboarding flow in Teams will help users discover the new experience and configure it to their preferences. Users who prefer to keep chat and channels separate can easily do so during the onboarding process or later, without IT assistance. \n</p><p>When the new experience is available in your tenant, this screen will display to users:\n</p><p><img src=\"https://img-prod-cms-rt-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/cms/api/am/imageFileData/RW1qg5W?ver=bbc1\" style=\"width: 400px;\" alt=\"user notification\">\n</p><p>The Get started button will take users to the new combined chat, teams, and channels experience in Chat, and highlight the location of settings. Users will have the option to defer the new experience up to three times over the course of approximately three days, providing flexibility while also moving an organization to the new experience overall.\n</p><p>This feature is on by default. The new experience has no admin policy. Each user can make choices to optimize for how they work best.\n</p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b>\n</p><p>This rollout will happen automatically by the specified date with no admin action required before the rollout. Review your current configuration to determine the impact for your organization. To help prepare organizations for the new features, product guides for admins and users will be available on the adoption web page <a href=\"https://adoption.microsoft.com/microsoft-teams/new-chat-and-channels-experience\" target=\"_blank\">The new Microsoft Teams chat and channels experience</a> before rollout begins.\n</p><p>For admins who <a href=\"https://support.microsoft.com/office/send-recommended-office-365-and-microsoft-365-training-81df76b4-1fca-430d-918e-b7fe03c3c056\" target=\"_blank\">opt in to emails for recommended Microsoft 365 training</a>, an email for users will summarize the update when released.</p>",

Starting early November 2024, Copilot Pages will become available for Microsoft Copilot users when signed in with an Entra account. This feature was previously only available for users with a paid Microsoft 365 Copilot license. Pages will be enabled by default and admin controls are available should you need to control the experience differently within your tenant.<br></p><p>Note: In September 2024, Pages started to roll out for Microsoft 365 Copilot users in Work mode of Business Chat (MC890882). This update will also roll out Pages to Web mode in Business Chat for Microsoft 365 Copilot users.\n</p><p>Note: Copilot Pages will only be available in Microsoft Copilot for users signed in with an Entra account who have an underlying SharePoint license. \n</p><p><b>When this will happen:</b><br></p><p>General Availability (Worldwide): We will begin rolling out Copilot Pages in early November 2024 and expect to complete by late November 2024.</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b><br></p><p>Recently, we <a href=\"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/copilot-for-microsoft-365/copilot-chat-available-in-business-chat/ba-p/4242701\" target=\"_blank\">announced Copilot Pages</a>, a first step in our new design system for knowledge work. Copilot Pages is a dynamic, persistent canvas in Copilot chat designed for multi-player collaboration. With Copilot Pages, you can turn insightful Copilot responses into something durable with a side-by-side page that you can view and edit and, when ready, share with your team to collaborate. \n</p><p>In a multiplayer approach, you can work together as a team to learn from each other’s prompts, and organize complex information. We see collaboration using Copilot Pages as the next great step forward in evolving Copilot from an individual, point-in-time exercise into a collaborative experience. \n</p><p>You can return to a page at any time by clicking the link in chat or the Open Page icon at the top of the associated Copilot session. Additionally, users can view all their pages in the Pages module in Microsoft365.com where they can also collaborate with others. \n</p><p>Created pages are stored in a user-owned SharePoint Embedded container. The container is lifetime-managed with the user account, so like OneDrive, the container and its content are deleted when the user account is deleted.\n</p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b><br></p><p>The feature will be automatically enabled when it rolls out unless you’ve used the following controls to manage the experience. If you wish to change the configuration of the feature, there are two ways to consider based on your needs.\n</p><p>You can use a Cloud Policy setting to prevent users from creating new Copilot pages in Microsoft Copilot, and/or use Conditional Access or Information Barriers policies to block certain users from accessing Copilot pages as needed.\n</p><p>Note: The controls for Copilot pages are the same for both free Microsoft Copilot (when signed in with an Entra account) and the paid Microsoft 365 Copilot license.\n</p><p>More information can be found here: <a href=\"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-365-copilot/copilot-pages-for-it-admins-sep-2024-update/ba-p/4241521\" target=\"_blank\">Copilot pages for IT Admins - Sep 2024 update</a>\n</p><p>Instructions for using the Cloud Policy to enable/disable Copilot pages in your tenant repeated here for ready reference:\n</p><ol><li>Sign in to <a href=\"https://config.office.com/\" target=\"_blank\">https://config.office.com/</a>&nbsp;with your Microsoft 365 admin credentials.\n</li><li>Select <b>Customization </b>from the left pane.\n</li><li>Select <b>Policy Management</b>.\n</li><li>Create a new policy configuration or edit an existing one.\n</li><li>From the <b>Choose the scope </b>dropdown list, choose either <b>All users </b>or select the group for which you want to apply the policy.

      "Content": "<p>Updated October 25, 2024: We have updated the rollout timeline and the phasing below. Thank you for your patience.</p><p>In 2023, we introduced Microsoft Teams apps that are compatible with Microsoft Outlook and the Microsoft 365 App (manifest version v1.13 or higher). Before this rollout, admin changes made in the Integrated apps section of the Microsoft 365 admin center would only affect these Teams apps in Outlook and the Microsoft 365 app. Similarly, changes made in the Teams admin center would exclusively affect Teams. Starting in June 2024, we will roll out Unified App Management to streamline the management of these apps across Teams, Outlook and the Microsoft 365 App, so they are consistently available across all supported clients.\n</p><p>This message is associated with Microsoft 365 Roadmap ID <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?filters=&amp;searchterms=393931\" target=\"_blank\">393931</a>.\n</p><p><b>When this will happen:</b>\n</p><p>This rollout will happen in two major phases. Unified App Management can apply only to tenants that have migrated to app centric management in Teams admin center, as communicated in MC688930 <i>(Updated) Teams admin center: App centric management and changes to app permission policies</i> (November 2023).\n</p><ul><li>Phase 1 | General Availability (Worldwide): We will begin rolling out mid-December 2024 (previously July 2024) and expect to complete mid-January 2025 (previously late November 2024). This phase applies to tenants with no modified settings in either the Microsoft 365 admin center (Integrated apps) or the Teams admin center for organization-wide defaults, app deployment, app availability, or block/unblock. No merge rules apply to these tenants, but after this phase, any app management setting configured in either admin centers will apply to all relevant hosts. \n</li><li>Phase 2: We will update this post with a timeline and more details. This phase is applicable to tenants with app settings that have differences between Microsoft 365 admin center (Integrated apps) and Teams admin center, and who have maintained a single app setup policy in Teams that has a modified Installed apps section.</li></ul><p>\n</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b>\n</p><p>Before this rollout, managing Teams apps that work in Outlook and the Microsoft 365 app was fragmented between the <i>Integrated app</i>s page in the Microsoft 365 admin center for Outlook and the Microsoft 365 app, and the Teams admin center for Teams. This sometimes resulted in different settings for the same app in the two admin centers. With Unified App Management, we will be consolidating app catalog management into a single platform. You will be able to manage apps on the <i>Integrated apps</i> page in the Microsoft 365 admin center or in the Teams admin center, and any changes made in either admin center will synchronize.\n</p><p><i>What you can expect</i>\n</p><ol><li>App catalog enhancements: Apps will start showing hosts where they are available: Teams, Outlook, or the Microsoft 365 app. \n</li><li>Organization-wide settings: App availability default settings will now apply to apps used in Teams, Outlook, and Microsoft 365 app.\n</li><li>App installs: Apps deployed from the Integrated apps page in Microsoft 365 admin center will be preinstalled in all applicable hosts for the app. Unlike app preinstallation in the Teams App setup policy, new app installs will provide access to the preinstalled apps, similar to deploying the app for Outlook and the Microsoft 365 App. <b>For more details on app deployment, refer to MC795355&nbsp;<i>Microsoft Teams admin center: App centric management for app installation and changes to app setup policies</i> (May 2024)</b>.</li><li>App availability: Managing app availability will apply to all applicable app hosts. \n</li><li>App block/unblock: Blocking or unblocking apps will apply to all applicable app hosts. \n</li><li>Consolidation of existing app settings: All existing app settings will be unified between Integrated apps (MAC) and Manage apps (TAC) pages. Merge rules can be found in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/MicrosoftTeams/manage-apps-across-m365\" target=\"_blank\">Manage apps that work across Teams, Outlook, and Microsoft 365 | Microsoft Learn</a>. These changes cannot be rolled back.\n</li><li>Consolidation report: Phase 2 and 3 tenant administrators will have access to an on-demand report prior to the merging of app settings. This report is designed to help administrators assess the impact of merge rules on their tenant and make any adjustments in advance. We will update this MC post when the report is available.\n</li></ol><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b>\n</p><p>We recommend that you review app and tenant settings in the Microsoft 365 admin center and the Teams admin center. If these are managed by different departments in your organization, we recommend conducting these reviews collaboratively.\n</p><p>We also recommend that you review the merge rules and consider their potential impact on apps in your organization. Make any necessary adjustments to unify them in advance, if the merge rules in this message do not align with your expectations.\n</p><p>This rollout will happen automatically by the specified date with no admin action required before the rollout. You may want to update any relevant documentation as appropriate.\n</p>",

Previously, meetings with only transcription enabled saved the transcript file to the meeting organizer’s Exchange Online, while meetings with both recording and transcription enabled saved two transcript copies—one that is coupled with the recording saved to OneDrive and another transcript copy saved to the meeting organizer’s Exchange Online.&nbsp;</p><p>Now with this feature, meetings that have only transcription enabled will also save two copies (one in OneDrive and one in Exchange Online), but all meeting transcript entry points in Teams app will point to the OneDrive copy only, no entry points for meeting transcripts will source from the Exchange Online copy. <i>At the same time</i>, meeting transcripts will stop saving in Exchange Online altogether and all transcript storage will be standardized on OneDrive only.&nbsp;</p><p>The rollout of this feature also improves both the experience of meeting organizers to manually delete the transcript, as well as the ability for IT administrators to apply retention policies to the transcripts from meetings that only had transcription enabled.&nbsp;</p><p>A summary of the deletion experience for meeting transcripts is captured in the following table:&nbsp;</p><p>\n</p><table>\n  <tbody><tr>\n    <th>User</th>\n    <th>Type of transcript deletion</th>\n    <th>Previous experience</th>\n<th>New Experience with this feature rollout</th>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <th>Meeting organizer/co-organizer </th>\n    <td>Manually from Teams app</td>\n    <td>Only deleted Exchange Online transcript file</td>\n<td>Deletes both copies of the transcript file from OneDrive and Exchange Online</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <th>Meeting organizer/co-organizer</th>\n    <td>Manually from Stream</td>\n    <td>Only deletes the transcript file stored in OneDrive</td>\n<td>Only deletes the transcript file stored in OneDrive</td>\n  </tr>\n<tr>\n    <th>IT Administrator</th>\n    <td>Retention policies in Teams Admin Center</td>\n    <td>Only available for copies saved in OneDrive, so only applicable to meetings with recording turned on.</td>\n<td><p>Now the retention policy is also applicable to meetings with only transcription enabled and to the transcript file saved in OneDrive.</p><p> \n \nTo bulk delete transcript files saved in Exchange Online—please refer to <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/delete-exchange-online-transcripts\" target=\"_blank\">this documentation</a> \n\n</p></td>\n  </tr>\n\n</tbody></table>\n\n<p></p><p>This message is associated with Microsoft 365 Roadmap ID <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?filters=&amp;searchterms=365720\" target=\"_blank\">365720</a></p>\n<p><b>When this will happen:</b> \n</p><p>Targeted release: We will begin rolling out early June 2024 (previously mid-May) and expect to complete by mid-June 2024 (previously late May). \n</p><p>General Availability (Worldwide, GCC): We will begin rolling out mid-June 2024 (previously late May) and expect to complete by late August 2024 (previously mid-August).\n</p><p>GCC High: We will begin rolling out late August 2024 and expect to complete by mid-September 2024.\n</p><p>DoD: We will begin rolling out late September 2024 and expect to complete by late November 2024 (previously mid-October).</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b> \n</p><p>There is no change to the end user experience for viewing and downloading Teams meeting transcripts. The only change for meeting organizers and co-organizers is for any meetings that are held after this feature rolls out, they can delete all copies of the meeting transcript directly from the Teams app, instead of having to manually delete all copies of the transcript from two places (Teams app and Stream). For IT administrators, they can start applying retention policies for the copy of the transcript saved in OneDrive, including scenarios where a meeting only had transcription enabled. This retention policy won’t affect the copies saved in Exchange Online, to bulk delete transcript files saved in Exchange Online—please refer to this <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/delete-exchange-online-transcripts\" target=\"_blank\">documentation</a>.</p><p>We will also update the default transcript permissions. After the rollout, when the new policy is not applied, only meeting organizers and co-organizers will have permission to download or delete the transcript file, and meeting participants can only view the transcript in Teams or Microsoft Stream. Regardless of whether the new policy is applied, the meeting organizer will be able to select in Stream the participants who are restricted from downloading, viewing, and editing the transcript in Stream.</p><p> \n</p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b>  \n</p><p>There is no action needed to prepare for this change.

The data will build up over the next 90 days. Thank you for your patience.</p><p>Today, we are announcing that Exchange Online will permanently remove support for Basic authentication with Client Submission (SMTP AUTH) in September 2025. After this time, applications and devices will no longer be able to use Basic auth as an authentication method and must use OAuth when using SMTP AUTH to send email.\n</p><p>Basic auth is a legacy authentication method that sends usernames and passwords in plain text over the network. This makes it vulnerable to credential theft, phishing, and brute force attacks. To improve the protection of our customers and their data, we are retiring Basic auth from Client Submission (SMTP AUTH) and encouraging customers to use modern authentication methods that are more secure.</p><p><b>When this will happen:</b></p><p>We will be making this change in September 2025.</p><p> \n</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b>\n</p><p>In September 2024, we will update the SMTP AUTH Clients Submission Report in the Exchange admin center to show if Basic auth or OAuth is being used to submit email to Exchange Online. In January 2025, we will send a Message Center post to tenants who are using Basic auth with Client Submission (SMTP AUTH) to alert them to the upcoming change. In August 2025, about 30 days before we disable Basic auth we will send another Message Center post to tenants who are still using Basic auth with Client Submission (SMTP AUTH).\n</p><p>During September 2025, we will remove support for Basic auth with the Client Submission (SMTP AUTH) endpoints:\n</p><ul><li>smtp.office365.com \n</li><li>smtp-legacy.office365.com \n</li></ul><p>Once Basic auth is permanently disabled, any clients or apps connecting using Basic auth with Client Submission (SMTP AUTH) will receive this response:\n</p><ul><li>550 5.7.30 Basic authentication is not supported for Client Submission.\n</li></ul><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b>\n</p><p>If your client supports OAuth, follow these steps: <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/exchange/client-developer/legacy-protocols/how-to-authenticate-an-imap-pop-smtp-application-by-using-oauth\" target=\"_blank\">Authenticate an IMAP, POP or SMTP connection using OAuth</a></p><p>If your client doesn’t support OAuth and you must use Basic Auth with Client Submission (SMTP AUTH), you will need to switch to one of the following alternatives before September 2025:</p><ul><li>If you are using basic authentication with Client Submission (SMTP AUTH) to send emails to recipients internal to your tenant, you can use Microsoft 365 High Volume Email.

Thank you for your patience.</p><p>In Exchange Online PowerShell (EXO) V3.0, we introduced the <code>Connect-ExchangeOnline</code> cmdlet to connect to the Microsoft Exchange Online environment through Microsoft PowerShell, which loads the help file by default. This help file is required for running the <code>Get-Help</code> cmdlet. However, not many customers used the <code>Get-Help</code> cmdlet. In EXO V3.3, we added the <code>-SkipLoadingCmdletHelp</code> parameter. When <code>-SkipLoadingCmdletHelp</code> is used with <code>Connect-ExchangeOnline</code>, help files do not load the on the customer system, which saves resources. \n</p><p>However, starting with EXO V3.7, we are changing this default behavior. The Help file will not be loaded by default, and a new parameter <code>-LoadCmdletHelp</code> will be required to load the cmdlet help and use the <code>Get-Help</code> cmdlet. To avoid breaking existing scripts, the <code>-SkipLoadingCmdletHelp</code> parameter will continue exist, but will not function.\n</p><p><b>When this will happen:</b>\n</p><p>General Availability (Worldwide): The changes will be available in EXO V3.7 (the next release of our EXO V3 module) in early November 2024.\n</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b>\n</p><p>Starting with EXO V3.7, if you want to use the <code>Get-Help</code> cmdlet, you will have to use the parameter <code>-LoadCmdletHelp</code> along with <code>Connect-ExchangeOnline</code>.\n</p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b>\n</p><p>This message only applies to customers who upgrade their EXO module version to 3.7.0.

Thank you for your patience.</p><p>&nbsp;As shared in the last communication, we are publishing guidance for owners of webhook-based connectors to update their URLs with a new structure. To allow ample time for replacing URLs, connector owners will have until <b>January 31, 2025, which is an extension from our previous deadline of December 31, 2024.</b> See below for complete guidance.</p><p>Webhook-based connectors within the O365 Connectors service in Teams are transitioning to a new URL structure due to the implementation of further service hardening updates. During this transition, you may receive notifications to update your configured connector to use the new URL. We strongly recommend that you update your connector immediately to prevent any disruption to connector services. URLs for all webhook-based connectors must be updated by January 31, 2025 for the connectors to continue posting messages into Teams. <b>Keep in mind the entire O365 Connectors service in Teams will be retired at the end of 2025</b>, so consider moving your webhooks to the Workflows app within Teams to avoid conducting another migration.

Go to<b> Manage Channel</b> in a Teams channel, select<b> Edit</b> under the Connectors option, and select <b>Configured </b>section. Review the existing connections listed on this page.</p><p>2.Do one of the following to generate a new URL:</p><ul><li>For connectors that contain a webhook URL, select <b>Manage</b> and <b>Update URL.</b></li><li>For other types of connectors, remove the connector and recreate the connector configuration.</li></ul><p>3. Replace the old URL with the new URL (or the new connection in the service that triggers the post).

This requirement ensures that only verified and properly signed code runs within Office applications, promoting code integrity and compliance with macOS development standards.</p><p>Workflow changes for users:</p><p>If your workflow uses unsigned dynamic libraries within Word, Excel, or PowerPoint for macOS, it no longer works as intended.

Unsigned or ad-hoc-signed libraries are no longer allowed to load into Office app processes.

Office applications support libraries codesigned for distribution through any Apple-supported distribution mechanism, including direct download by your customers.</p><p>Steps for admins:</p><ul><li>Verify Deployed non-Microsoft Products: Check if you have any non-Microsoft products deployed to your users. These products often:<ul><li>Extend Office functionality by adding menu or ribbon controls.\n</li><li>Communicate with other applications to share content with Office.\n</li><li>Support external data connections such as ODBC.\n</li></ul></li><li>Confirm codesigning compliance: Make sure that any non-Microsoft products follow best practices and codesigned any dynamic libraries included in their products. If any libraries aren't codesigned, contact the product developer for updates.</li><li>Monitor system logs: Inspect the system console logs for Library Load Constraint Rejection messages. These messages from macOS identify any dynamic library that the OS rejects from loading into an Office app process.</li><li>Consider proactively blocking all non-Microsoft libraries: To block these libraries, set the Office preference DisableVisualBasicExternalDylibs to true using Mobile Device Management (MDM) software.

Thank you for your patience.</p><p>Starting October 16, 2024, we're gradually enabling IPv6 for all customer Accepted Domains that use Exchange Online for inbound mail. Microsoft is modernizing Exchange Online so our customers can easily meet their local regulations as well as benefit from the enhanced security and performance offered by IPv6.<br></p><p>More information on IPv6 support for Microsoft 365 services can be found at: <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/enterprise/ipv6-support?view=o365-worldwide\" target=\"_blank\">IPv6 support in Microsoft 365 services</a></p><p><b>When this will happen:</b></p><p>October 16, 2024 (previously October 1, 2024)</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b>\n</p><p>After we enable IPv6 for your Accepted Domains, when someone tries to send an email to one of your users and queries the MX record for the domain, they will receive both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses (AAAA records) in response to their MX record query.    \n</p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b>\n</p><p>To take advantage of IPv6 connectivity, please make sure that you and your partner's update network allow-lists to allow Exchange Online IPv6 endpoints in the same way it allow-lists IPv4.\n</p><p>The Exchange Online IPv6 endpoints can be found here: <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/enterprise/urls-and-ip-address-ranges?view=o365-worldwide\" target=\"_blank\">Microsoft 365 URLs and IP address ranges</a>.\n</p><p>To opt a domain out of inbound IPv6 so traffic flowing to the domain remains IPv4-only,  please use <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/module/exchange/disable-ipv6foraccepteddomain?view=exchange-ps\" target=\"_blank\">Disable-IPv6ForAcceptedDomain -Domain for each domain you want to opt out of IPv6 (Disable-IPv6ForAcceptedDomain (ExchangePowerShell) | Microsoft Learn)</a>.\n</p><p>IPv6 enablement may impact the source IP type used by Senders when connecting to Exchange Online, as the source and destination IP versions must match. For any IP Address-based Inbound connectors in Exchange Online that are referencing IPv4 addresses, you need to either:\n</p><ul><li>Keep the sending server as IPv4.\n<ul><li>Coordinate with the Sender so the Sender keeps connecting to your domain(s) via IPv4 or Opt your domain(s) out of IPv6\n</li></ul></li><li>Change the IP based connector to certificate domain based connector.\n<ul><li>This applies to both OnPremises type (From: <i>Your organization's email server</i>, To: <i>Office 365</i>) and Partner Type connectors (From: <i>Partner organization</i>, To: <i>Office 365</i>).</li></ul></li></ul><p></p><ul></ul><p></p><p>Update: If you are using any Exchange Transport Rules or Data Loss Prevention policies which rely on the SenderIPRanges predicate, you need to opt out all your domains from IPv6.</p><p>You can manage IPv6 for your Exchange Online Accepted Domains using the commands Enable-IPv6ForAcceptedDomain or Disable-IPv6ForAcceptedDomain.\n</p><p>Currently, you can check the status of your Accepted Domains with the Get-IPv6StatusForAcceptedDomain command. While some customers have already enabled IPv6, most will see it as disabled until October 16th.\n</p><p>After October 16, once IPv6 is enabled for your tenant, if you haven't explicitly set the IPv6 status for your Accepted Domains, the Get-IPv6StatusForAcceptedDomain command will reflect the new default behavior (enabled). \n</p><p><b>IMPORTANT:</b> To ensure your preferred settings are applied, please use the Enable-IPv6ForAcceptedDomain or Disable-IPv6ForAcceptedDomain commands before October 16th, after which IPv6 will be enabled by default if you haven't explicitly set it.</p><p>If you have enabled DNSSEC for mail flow, you may have issues executing the Get-IPv6StatusForAcceptedDomain cmdlet for the DNSSEC-enabled domain. We are rolling out the fix now. Please ensure to run Disable-IPv6ForAcceptedDomain to opt out of the IPv6 enablement if you need to opt a DNSSEC-enabled domain out of the IPv6 by default rollout. The IPv6 rollout will not affect DNSSEC-enabled domains until after Nov 18th.</p><p>\n</p><p>\n</p>",

The time required to build the index depends on the number of items in your users’ OneDrive and SharePoint.  For a medium-to-large tenant, this may take days to a week to complete.  Very large tenants will take longer.  While the index is provisioning, search requests will only return shared and public content.  Once the new index is complete, private and shared content will be returned.  If no additional search requests for private content are sent within 100 days, the private index will be decommissioned.  If needed again, a subsequent search request for private content will rebuild the index.\n</p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b>\n</p><p>If you have applications which run infrequently (e.g. every four months) and use Search with Application Permissions, plan for time to allow the on-demand index to rebuild. \n</p><p>Please click Additional Information to learn more.\n</p><p><a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/graph/search-concept-searchall?view=graph-rest-1.0\" target=\"_blank\">Search content with application permissions - Microsoft Graph | Microsoft Learn</a>\n</p>",

After this date, the app will no longer receive support, and the app will become read only.\n</p><p>To ensure the best experience moving forward, we strongly recommend switching your users to the <a href=\"https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/xpffzhvgqwwlhb?ocid=pdpshare&amp;hl=en-us&amp;gl=US\" target=\"_blank\">Microsoft OneNote for Windows</a> app as soon as possible. Our team is focusing on enhancing this app, providing a sleek and modern interface and improving security, and releasing new features like Loop components, voice dictation and transcription, ink improvements, a new meeting details experience, integration with the new Microsoft Outlook, and more to align with the evolving needs of our users.\n</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b>\n</p><p>Although OneNote for Windows 10 is supported until October 14, 2025, it is no longer receiving new feature updates, and it does not benefit from improvements to data syncing.\n</p><p>Starting in January 2025, users will start to see notifications in OneNote for Windows 10 about the end of support. These notifications will provide additional information and direct users to resources for a smooth transition.\n</p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b>\n</p><p><i>1.

This sample script is designed to simplify the migration process for IT admins and to ensure that your users' unsynchronized data is backed up during migration. We believe this migration guidance will significantly help in achieving a successful migration process.\n</p><p><i>2. OneNote migration support in October 2024:</i>\n</p><p>To ensure a smooth transition, we are offering additional support from the OneNote team to help with the migration process for tenants who want to migrate early. The team is only available in the month of October 2024. After that, you will need to rely on the deployment guidance. To engage the OneNote team in October 2024, please provide feedback as usual on this post and include your email address.\n</p><p><i>3. App download restrictions for new users:</i></p><p>Starting November 1, 2024, new users will no longer be able to download OneNote for Windows 10 from the Microsoft Store. Given the app is approaching end of support and we are recommending using OneNote for Windows instead, we’re restricting new users from being able to install OneNote for Windows 10 moving forward. If you currently have the application installed, you will still be able to use it and receive updates until the end of support.\n</p><p>We are committed to supporting you through this transition and ensuring that your migration to OneNote for Windows is as seamless as possible.\n</p><p><i>Learn more\n</i></p><ul><li><a href=\"https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/XPFFZHVGQWWLHB?ocid=pdpshare\" target=\"_blank\">Download OneNote for Windows</a> from the Microsoft Store\n</li><li><a href=\"https://support.microsoft.com/office/what-is-happening-to-onenote-for-windows-10-2b453bfe-66bc-4ab2-9118-01e7eb54d2d6#:~:text=We%20recently%20announced%20the%20availability%20of%20the%20OneNote,Windows%2010%20will%20reach%20end-of-support%20in%20Oct%202025.\" target=\"_blank\">What is happening to OneNote for Windows 10 - Microsoft Support</a>\n</li><li><a href=\"https://support.microsoft.com/office/moving-to-onenote-on-windows-4ba7b498-aafc-44b1-8326-a582a6c71196\" target=\"_blank\">Moving to OneNote on Windows - Microsoft Support</a>\n</li><li><a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoft-365-apps/deploy/deployment-guide-onenote\" target=\"_blank\">Deployment guide for OneNote - Microsoft 365 Apps | Microsoft Learn</a></li></ul><p></p>",

      "Content": "<p>Updated September 26, 2024: This feature is now live and is active in your tenant.</p><p>Coming soon for Microsoft Fabric: Two new settings in the <a href=\"https://app.fabric.microsoft.com/admin-portal/tenantSettings?experience=power-bi\" target=\"_blank\">Fabric Admin portal</a> that are designed to enhance security and flexibility for applications interacting with Microsoft OneLake.   \n</p><p><b>When this will happen:</b>\n</p><p>Public Preview: We will begin rolling out late September 2024 and expect to complete by late September 2024. You can start saving your settings in late August 2024.\n</p><p>When the General Availability release timeline is known, we will update you.\n</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b>\n</p><p>Before this rollout: Users could not generate SAS tokens in OneLake.\n</p><p>After this rollout: Admins will have support for short-lived user-delegated OneLake shared access signature (SAS) tokens in public preview. This functionality allows applications to request a user delegation key backed by a Microsoft Entra ID, which can then be used to build a OneLake SAS token. This token can be handed off to provide delegated access to another tool, node, or user, ensuring secure and controlled access.  OneLake SAS tokens are constructed and used similarly to <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/rest/api/storageservices/create-user-delegation-sas\" target=\"_blank\">Azure Storage SAS tokens</a>, with a few key differences: \n</p><ul><li>OneLake user delegation keys and SAS tokens cannot exceed a lifetime of one hour.  \n</li><li>OneLake SAS tokens are always user delegated and must be backed by an Entra ID.  \n</li><li>OneLake SAS can only grant access to data items in Fabric.\n</li></ul><p>The usage of OneLake SAS in a Fabric tenant is controlled by two tenant switches:\n</p><ol><li>A switch managed by tenant admins that controls the generation of OneLake SAS tokens\n</li><li>A switch automatically delegated to workspace admins that controls the acceptance of OneLake SAS tokens\n</li></ol><p>Both switches must be turned on to allow the use of OneLake SAS in a workspace.\n</p><p><i>Scenarios supported by SAS \n</i></p><p>Delegated access with SAS tokens allows applications without native support for Microsoft Entra to gain temporary access to specific folders or files in OneLake. SAS tokens are commonly used for data integration workloads by granting external engines temporary permissions to write data to a staging location.  Many ISVs also use SAS tokens to grant their users temporary scoped-down access to their data.   \n</p><p><i>New tenant settings</i>\n</p><p>1. <i>Use Short-lived user-delegated SAS tokens</i> (Preview):\n</p><ul><li>Default Status: ON\n</li><li>This setting allows the creation of short-lived user-delegated SAS tokens by turning on the user delegation key API for the entire tenant.   \n</li></ul><p>2. <i>Authenticate with OneLake user-delegated SAS tokens</i> (Preview): \n</p><ul><li>Default Status: OFF \n</li><li>This setting enables authentication using OneLake user-delegated SAS tokens. This setting is automatically delegated to workspace admins, allowing them to decide whether their workspace will accept OneLake SAS as a valid authentication method.  \n</li></ul><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b>\n</p><p>1. Review and decide on settings: \n</p><ul><li><i>Use short-lived user-delegated SAS tokens:</i> As this setting is turned ON by default, please review its implications and decide if it should remain enabled for your organization. \n</li><li><i>Authenticate with OneLake user-delegated SAS tokens</i>: This setting is OFF by default, and workspace admins will be able to enable this feature. Evaluate its potential benefits and determine if you would like to enable it automatically for all workspaces.  \n</li></ul><p>2. Action for tenant admins: \n</p><ul><li>In late September 2024, OneLake SAS will be available in public preview. If no actions are taken on the tenant setting, workspace admins will be able to turn ON OneLake SAS authentication for their workspace. Note that <i>Authenticate with OneLake user-delegated SAS tokens</i> is automatically delegated to workspace admins. If you prefer not to have these features available for your organization, please turn OFF the <i>Use short-lived user-delegated SAS tokens</i> setting in Fabric before late September 2024. This will disable OneLake SAS generation for your tenant, ensuring OneLake SAS cannot be used, regardless of the workspace admins setting.  \n</li><li>Workspace admins will be able to enable authentication with SAS tokens for their workspaces if no action is taken by tenant admins.  \n</li><li>We encourage you to assess these new settings and make any necessary changes to align with your organization's security and access control policies. \n</li></ul><p>If you have any questions or need further assistance, please do not hesitate to contact our support team. \n</p><p>This rollout will happen automatically by the specified dates with no admin action required before the rollout. You may want to notify your admins about this change and update any relevant documentation.\n</p><p>Explore <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/fabric/\" target=\"_blank\">Microsoft Fabric documentation</a>.

Each of these versions in Microsoft OneDrive and Microsoft SharePoint count the full file size towards consumed storage quota. Thus, for large video and audio files, these versions cause your storage consumption to quickly increase.<br></p><p>To prevent this, we are changing how Microsoft Stream handles versioning. Any changes made specifically to chapters and transcripts of files from Stream will stop making versions, thus preventing storage from increasing as rapidly as it has in the past.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>\n</p><p>This message is associated with Microsoft 365 Roadmap ID <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?filters=&amp;searchterms=395380\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"\">395380</a></p><p><b>When this will happen:</b></p><p>General Availability (Worldwide): We will begin rolling out mid-July 2024 and expect to complete by late August 2024.&nbsp;</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b>\n</p><p>Changes to video and audio files from Stream will no longer take version snapshots.

Moving forward, users with work or school accounts will access Microsoft Copilot through the Microsoft 365 app. In addition, Microsoft Copilot will offer enterprise data protection (EDP) at no additional cost for all users signed in with an Entra account. This means that security, privacy, and compliance controls and commitments available for Microsoft 365 Copilot will extend to Microsoft Copilot prompts and responses.  \n</p><p><b>When will this happen?</b></p><p>The update to Microsoft Copilot to offer enterprise data protection is rolling out now—and is replacing the current Copilot in Windows experience. The shift to the Microsoft 365 app as the entry point for Microsoft Copilot is coming soon. Changes will be rolled out to managed PCs starting with the optional non-security preview release on September 24, 2024, and following with the monthly security update release on October 8 for all supported versions of Windows 11. These changes will be applied to Windows 10 PCs the month after.  \n</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b></p><p>If your organization hasn’t enabled Copilot in Windows (in preview), your existing preferences will be respected. Neither the Microsoft Copilot app nor the Microsoft 365 app are pinned to the taskbar. \n</p><p>If you had previously activated Copilot in Windows (in preview) for your workforce, to provide the best Copilot experience for your employees moving forward, we won't automatically pin the Microsoft 365 app to the taskbar in Windows. Rather, we'll ensure that you have control over how you enable the Copilot experience within your organization. If you want your users to have uninterrupted access to Microsoft Copilot after the update, use the configuration options to pin the Microsoft 365 app to the taskbar as the Copilot in Windows (preview) icon will be removed from the taskbar as part of the update. \n</p><p>Users signing into new PCs with work or school accounts can access Microsoft Copilot using the Microsoft 365 app, which comes pre-installed with all Windows PCs.

Thank you for your patience.</p><p>Soon, on Windows and macOS devices running the OneDrive sync app, we will enable a new feature called “Offline mode” that will allow you to continue working with the OneDrive web app in your browser, OneDrive PWA (Progressive Web App) or Microsoft Teams even when you are offline. This feature will be on by default and will give your users the ability to view, rename, move, copy their files, and create new folders when offline. Users will be able to open their files that are available offline on users’ device in a native app directly from inside OneDrive on the web. All of the metadata changes users make offline to their files in the browser will be automatically synced back to OneDrive when Internet connection is restored, and users can resolve conflicts, if there are any. As an administrator, you’ll be able to control various aspects of Offline mode using the Group Policies outlined in <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/sharepoint/use-group-policy\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.</p><p>When this feature becomes enabled for users in your organization and the user then visits OneDrive for web, Offline mode will be set up for the first time.

This feature will proactively terminate active user or admin sessions, or require reauthentication, and enforce tenant policy changes in near real time instead of waiting for an access token to expire.\n</p><p><b>When this will happen:</b>\n</p><p>General Availability (Worldwide): We will begin rolling out mid-September 2024 and expect to complete by late September 2024.\n</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b>\n</p><p>CAE is the feature that allows user or admin sessions to be revoked when certain critical events occur, or the location of the user or admin is not in the allowed IP address range. The access will be terminated almost instantly, instead of waiting for a token to expire.\n</p><p>OAuth 2.0 authentication (open authentication) traditionally relies on access token expiration to revoke a user's access to modern cloud services. Users or admins whose access rights have been terminated still have access to resources until the access token expires. For the Microsoft 365 admin center, this access can be as long as an hour, by default. With continuous access evaluation, a user's critical events and network location changes are continuously evaluated.\n</p><p>Enabling CAE offers several key benefits:\n</p><ul><li><i>Mitigate insider and data exfiltration threats: </i>An employee can export a valid access token and replay it to gain access to admin center from outside of your organization. With continuous access evaluation, you can enforce IP location policies and monitor user-critical events in near real time to mitigate the risk of external access and exfiltration of data.\n</li><li><i>Prevent unauthorized access:</i> When a user account password is compromised, the Microsoft Entra administrator can reset it or disable the account in near real time to prevent unauthorized access to admin center.\n</li><li><i>Remove user access in near real time: </i>Organizations have an obligation to instantly remove an admin or user's access because of security threats, termination of employment, policy violations, or legal requirements. With continuous access evaluation, the Microsoft Entra administrator can instantly disable admin or user accounts and revoke access to organization resources in near real time.\n</li></ul><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b>\n</p><p>This rollout will happen automatically by the specified date with no admin action required before the rollout. You may want to notify your admins about this change and update any relevant documentation.\n</p><p>Learn more: <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/identity/conditional-access/concept-continuous-access-evaluation\" target=\"_blank\">Continuous access evaluation in Microsoft Entra - Microsoft Entra ID | Microsoft Learn</a>\n</p><p>CAE will be supported in Microsoft 365 admin center.

You can expect the previous domains to be redirected to cloud.microsoft in the coming months.&nbsp;</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b>\n</p><ul><li>The cloud.microsoft domain has been a part of standard <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/enterprise/urls-and-ip-address-ranges\" target=\"_blank\">Microsoft network guidance on domains and service endpoints</a> since April 2023. If you are currently following this guidance, <i>this change should not impact users in your organization using the above applications under the new domain.\n</i></li><li>Users will be redirected to applications under cloud.microsoft domains gradually and automatically. No specific user action is required. Links to the previous domains are backwards compatible and continue to be supported. Users may notice that the new application domains are lacking the “.com” extension.  This is by design, as “.microsoft” is Microsoft’s own top-level domain – and this exclusivity allows for additional security and protection against spoofing.</li></ul><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b>\n</p><ul><li>Educate users to recognize and expect cloud.microsoft as a key domain for Microsoft cloud experiences. You can refer them to <a href=\"https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/what-is-cloud-microsoft-7ba4c8b9-d062-4444-84a5-fca6c3006d2b\" target=\"_blank\">What is cloud.microsoft? - Microsoft Support</a> for more information.\n</li><li>If your organizational websites, tools, or other materials reference the old URL, those links will be automatically redirected. However, it would be good practice to update those assets to avoid user confusion.\n</li><li>Partner with developers of in-house Teams apps - including those that run on Outlook and Microsoft 365 - to take the actions described in <a href=\"https://devblogs.microsoft.com/microsoft365dev/action-required-ensure-your-microsoft-teams-apps-are-ready-for-upcoming-domain-changes/\" target=\"_blank\">Action required: ensure your Microsoft Teams apps are ready for upcoming domain changes</a> so the apps continue to function on the new domain. \n</li><li>Admins should ensure that connections to *.cloud.microsoft are not blocked from their clients and enterprise networks. This should require no action if standard <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/enterprise/urls-and-ip-address-ranges\" target=\"_blank\">Microsoft network guidance on domains and service endpoints</a> is being followed.</li></ul>",

Users can easily revert to an older version if business needs change or if files are damaged by user error or malware.

Based on strong customer feedback, we will release enhanced version storage controls so you can meet your needs efficiently and at scale.\n</p><p>This message is associated with Microsoft 365 Roadmap ID <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/roadmap?filters=&amp;searchterms=145802\" target=\"_blank\">145802</a>.\n</p><p><b>When this will happen:</b>\n</p><p>Public Preview: We will begin rolling out early May 2024 and expect to complete by late June 2024.

Previously, document library owners could set count-based version limits at the library level. With this rollout, we are introducing new automatic version limits that consider important factors such as age and restore probability to offer more intelligent version deleting&nbsp;options. We’re also adding manual settings for version expiration and count limits.\n</p><p>Here is a summary of the new capabilities introduced with this rollout:\n</p><ul><li><i>New Version history limit</i> options to meet your organization’s recovery objectives and version storage targets. Set version limits to:\n<ul><li><i>Automatically optimize</i> version recovery and storage without estimating limits; or\n</li><li><i>Manually limit</i> versions by count or version age.\n</li></ul></li><li><i>Set default organization Version history limits</i> on new document libraries and Microsoft OneDrive accounts for consistent version storage setting on all new libraries and OneDrive accounts created through the organization.\n</li><li><i>Set Site or Library level Version history limits</i> to meet specific content needs by breaking inheritance from organization defaults.\n</li><li><i>Report on version storage use of a site or library</i> by generating a CSV report to analyze current usage trends or impact analysis.\n</li><li><i>Delete versions from a site or library</i> to reduce existing version storage footprint or align with new limits.\n</li></ul><p>After this rollout completes, you can expect these changes:\n</p><p>1. New <i>Version history limits</i> settings in SharePoint admin center: Admins can set global defaults for all new libraries created in the organization. By default, the organization-level <i>Version history</i> limit will be set to M<i>anually</i> delete versions. Within the Manual limits, the default <i>Number of major versions</i> is set to 500 and the <i>Time</i> period is set to <i>Never expire.</i>\n</p><p><img src=\"https://img-prod-cms-rt-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/cms/api/am/imageFileData/RW1h5nt?ver=1a35\" style=\"width: 400px;\" alt=\"admin controls\">\n</p><p>2. New <i>Version time limit</i> setting for Document libraries: In addition to existing <i>Version count limits</i>, users can set <i>Version time limits</i> to delete versions based on age. <i>Version time limits</i> will be on the library's <i>Version settings</i> page. No change will be made to existing version limits applied to the library.\n</p><p>3. New <i>Expiring in</i> column on a file's <i>Version history</i> view: Users will be able to:\n</p><ul><li>View an expiration applied to a file's versions based on the library settings\n</li><li>Set individual file versions to never expire\n</li></ul><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b>\n</p><p>Review updated documentation:</p><p>\n</p><ul><li>Admin documentation: <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/sharepoint/document-library-version-history-limits\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"\">Overview of Version History Limits for Document Libraries and OneDrive</a></li><li>End user documentation: <a href=\"https://support.microsoft.com/office/enable-and-configure-versioning-for-a-list-or-library-1555d642-23ee-446a-990a-bcab618c7a37\" target=\"_blank\">Enable and configure versioning for a list or library</a>\n</li></ul><p>To send feedback or questions about this change, select <i>Like</i> or <i>Dislike</i> at the top of this message in the Microsoft 365 message center.</p>",

      "Content": "<p>Updated August 9, 2024: We have updated the rollout timeline below. Thank you for your patience.</p><p>Microsoft Purview: We are excited to announce upcoming enhancements to Microsoft Purview Data Loss Prevention (DLP). With the forthcoming update, the capability to scan, classify, and protect sensitive content on Windows endpoint devices will be significantly expanded. The number of supported file types will increase from approximately 40 to over 100, aligning endpoint coverage with other platforms like Exchange, SharePoint, and OneDrive. Additionally, this update will introduce several key enhancements, including:</p>\n\n<ul><li>Detection of labels from protected files (pfiles).\n</li><li>Identification of sensitive content within file metadata.\n</li><li>Recognition of sensitive information in PDF form fields.</li><li>Detection of sensitive information in files embedded inside office files (for example, a .txt file inside .pptx file)</li></ul><p>This message is associated with Microsoft 365 Roadmap ID <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?rtc=1%26filters=&amp;searchterms=171586\" target=\"_blank\">171586</a></p><p>\n</p>\n\n<p><b>When this will happen:</b></p><p>Public Preview: We will begin rolling out late June (previously late July) 2024 and expect to complete by late October 2024 (previously early October).</p><p>General Availability Worldwide: We will begin rolling out late October 2024 (previously early November) and expect to complete by late November 2024 (previously late October).\n</p>\n\n<p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b></p><p>The upcoming update will enhance DLP's content scanning on Windows devices. No changes to existing policies are required.</p><p>Summary of enhancements:</p><p>1.\tEnhanced file type coverage\n</p>\n\n<p>The file type coverage to scan, classify, and protect sensitive content on Windows Endpoint devices will increase from 40 file types to over 100. \n</p><p>This means that sensitive content in additional file types like BZ2, EML etc. will also start getting scanned and protected using DLP policies.</p><p>\n</p>\n\n<p>2.\tDetect label in PFILE</p><p>The DLP condition \"content contains sensitivity label\" now has the capability to detect labels from protected files (pfiles). This means that it can now read labels not just from Office and PDF files, but all other files where MIP label with protection can be applied via applications like AIP client, Secude etc. which converts the file into “pfile”.</p><p>Picture 1:</p><p><img src=\"https://img-prod-cms-rt-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/cms/api/am/imageFileData/RW1l3RK?ver=e328\" style=\"width: 400px;\"></p><p>A txt file converted to .ptxt (PFile) after applying a label. This label can now be detected with this preview.\n</p>\n\n<p>3.\tScanning metadata\n</p>\n\n<p>Ability to detect sensitive content in file metadata like custom properties in Office and PDF files.</p><p>Picture 2:</p><p><img src=\"https://img-prod-cms-rt-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/cms/api/am/imageFileData/RW1l1kz?ver=7fc6\" style=\"width: 400px;\"></p><p>4.\tScanning content embedded in Microsoft 365 office files\n</p>\n\n<p>If a file is embedded inside an office file (Microsoft Word/Excel/PowerPoint), the content of the embedded file is also scanned. For example, if a DOCX file containing credit card numbers is inserted into an XLSX file, the content of both XLSX and the embedded DOCX files will be scanned, and credit card numbers will be detected.\n</p><p>Picture 3:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://img-prod-cms-rt-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/cms/api/am/imageFileData/RW1lbkd?ver=777d\" style=\"width: 400px;\"></p><p>5.\tBetter scanning with PDF files\n</p>\n\n<p>·\tAbility to scan and detect sensitive content in PDF forms.\n</p>\n\n<p>·\tAbility to scan and detect sensitive content in permission protected PDF files. Permission protected PDF files are ones which do not require any password to open the file and read the content but require a password to edit/copy the content.\n</p>\n\n<p>Picture 4:</p><p><img src=\"https://img-prod-cms-rt-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/cms/api/am/imageFileData/RW1l3RN?ver=d64f\" style=\"width: 400px;\"></p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b>\n</p>\n\n<p>You do not need do any changes to your existing policies. Your existing policies will seamlessly start scanning additional content as detailed above.</p><p>Additional Resources</p>\n\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/purview/endpoint-dlp-learn-about?view=o365-worldwide#monitored-files\" target=\"_blank\">Learn about Endpoint data loss prevention | Microsoft Learn</a></li></ul>",

Admins can view these accounts with admin tools, but the accounts will not be accessible to users until admins take action on them. For example, a OneDrive account that became unlicensed on August 1, 2025 will be inaccessible to users as of October 1, 2025.</p><p>As an admin, you can view a list of unlicensed accounts in your tenant by navigating to SharePoint admin center &gt; <i>Reports &gt; OneDrive accounts</i>. Some admins will have access to this page as soon as July 26, 2024, but most admins will be able to access the page closer to August 16, 2024.\n</p><ul><li>Set up the Archive billing for unlicensed accounts to be able to access and edit the archived files.\n</li><li>Delete the unlicensed OneDrive account, if it does not have a retention policy applied to it. \n</li><li>Renew the unlicensed account to maintain access.\n</li></ul><p></p><p>The <i>Unlicensed OneDrive accounts</i> page that will be in Microsoft admin center:\n</p><p><img src=\"https://img-prod-cms-rt-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/cms/api/am/imageFileData/RW1nwuw?ver=dea1\" style=\"width: 400px;\" alt=\"admin controls\"> \n</p><p>After the unlicensed accounts are automatically archived, you can access the files in these accounts by enabling unlicensed account billing in the Microsoft 365 admin center. Once enabled, unlicensed account billing applies to all unlicensed OneDrive accounts in your tenant. There is a fee of $0.05/GB/month to store unlicensed accounts in the Microsoft 365 Archive, and a fee of $0.60/GB to reactivate accounts stored in the Microsoft 365 Archive. Account reactivation takes up to 24 hours and provides 30 days of access to the account, and then the account returns to an archived state.\n</p><p>If you take no action for OneDrive accounts that have been unlicensed for longer than 90 days, these accounts will remain inaccessible to end users until you set up an Azure subscription and enable unlicensed account billing in the Microsoft SharePoint admin center. This action will not affect tenants who have not changed the default tenant retention settings.\n</p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare</b>\n</p><p>To prepare for this change, admins can view a list of all the unlicensed OneDrive accounts in their tenant by going to the SharePoint admin center and navigating to <i>Reports &gt; OneDrive accounts</i> (this page will be rolled out to admins between July 26, 2024 and August 16, 2024). This page will provide the number of unlicensed accounts and why the accounts are unlicensed. You may have unlicensed accounts in your tenant for four reasons: \n</p><ol><li>Retention period – Account is no longer licensed but is still active because a retention period setting is keeping the account from being deleted.\n</li><li>Retention policy – Account is no longer licensed but is still active because a retention policy in Purview is keeping the account from being deleted. \n</li><li>Active user with no license – Account is active but is not licensed. This can happen if the license is removed but the user is not removed from Microsoft Entra ID (formerly Azure Active Directory).  \n</li><li>Duplicate accounts – Account is a duplicate because a licensed user has multiple OneDrive accounts associated with them. Duplicate accounts (also known as non-primary accounts) may arise if a user has geographic move, if a user leaves and then rejoins an organization, or from other factors. \n</li></ol><p>After you have taken inventory of your unlicensed accounts, we recommend that you take the following action before January 27, 2025. \n</p><ol><li>Delete unlicensed accounts that you no longer wish to retain. \n</li><li>Set up billing for accounts that you wish to retain.\n</li><li>You may want to notify your users about this change and update any relevant documentation.\n</li></ol><p>*<b>At this time, these changes do not apply to customers in Education tenants. An Education tenant is any tenant with more than 50% education licenses. Any tenant with fewer than 50% education licenses is considered commercial.&nbsp;</b>However, for any education tenant, unlicensed OneDrive accounts consume pooled storage and can pose security and compliance risks. IT admins can view the unlicensed accounts on the <i>OneDrive accounts</i> page to identify unlicensed accounts and take action.</p><p><i>Learn more</i>\n</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/SharePoint/unlicensed-onedrive-accounts\" target=\"_blank\">Manage unlicensed OneDrive user accounts - SharePoint in Microsoft 365 | Microsoft Learn</a>\n</li><li><a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/sharepoint/retention-and-deletion\" target=\"_blank\">OneDrive retention and deletion - SharePoint in Microsoft 365 | Microsoft Learn</a>\n</li><li><a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/admin/add-users/delete-a-user?view=o365-worldwide\" target=\"_blank\">Delete a user from your organization - Microsoft 365 admin | Microsoft Learn</a></li></ul><p></p>",

This new integration leverages DLM features to provide an additional control for Adaptive protection that automatically preserves items deleted by a user with an elevated risk level, so items can be restored if needed.\n</p><p>This message is associated with Microsoft 365 Roadmap ID <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?filters=&amp;searchterms=392839\" target=\"_blank\">392839</a>.\n</p><p><b>When this will happen:</b>\n</p><p>Public preview: We will begin rolling out in late June 2024 (previously early May) and expect to complete by late July 2024 (previously mid-July).\n</p><p>General Availability: We will begin rolling out in mid-December 2024 (previously mid-May) and expect to complete by late December 2024 (previously late June).</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b>\n</p><p>After the rollout, and after you enable Adaptive protection for your tenant, the retention label and auto-apply policy for data lifecycle management will be automatically created for you. This policy will automatically include elevated risk users identified by Microsoft Purview | Insider Risk Management solution. If these users delete content from Microsoft SharePoint, Microsoft OneDrive, or Microsoft Exchange, a retention label is automatically applied to that content to retain it for 120 days. Retention labels are automatically applied to unlabeled content deleted by these users. When these users are no longer at the elevated risk level, they are automatically removed from the DLM policy, and the system will no longer keep a copy of content they delete. Any content copies previously retained when the user had an elevated risk level will be kept for the 120 days as specified by the retention label.\n</p><p>Unlike other retention labeling scenarios, users do not see the retention label, and you do not need to create or manage the retention label or policy. At this time, you can't change the retention period or assign different policies based on the different risk levels, or for different locations. The single retention label and auto-labeling policy for your tenant is not visible in the Microsoft Purview compliance portal.</p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b>\n</p><p>Learn more: <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/purview/retention#dynamically-mitigate-the-risk-of-accidental-or-malicious-deletes\" target=\"_blank\">Learn about retention policies &amp; labels to retain or delete | Microsoft Learn</a>\n</p><p>If you're using Adaptive protection and want to automatically retain content deleted by elevated risk users, follow these steps to turn on this new integration.\n</p><ol><li>Sign in to the <a href=\"https://compliance.microsoft.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Microsoft Purview compliance portal</a>.\n</li><li>Navigate to <i>Data lifecycle management &gt; Microsoft 365 &gt; Adaptive protection settings</i> in the top right corner.\n</li><li>Turn the setting ON and select <i>Save</i>.\n</li></ol><p>\n</p><p><img src=\"https://img-prod-cms-rt-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/cms/api/am/imageFileData/RW1l8xK?ver=d8ce\" style=\"width: 400px;\" alt=\"admin settings\">\n</p><p><img src=\"https://img-prod-cms-rt-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/cms/api/am/imageFileData/RW1l5Gc?ver=80b1\" style=\"width: 400px;\" alt=\"admin settings\">\n</p><p>If you’re not using Adaptive protection already, turn on Adaptive protection and the new feature will be enabled along with Adaptive protection.\n</p><p>This rollout will happen automatically by the specified date with no admin action required before the rollout.

As part of that change, Viva Engage will return to a simplified topics model, called Engage topics, and the integration with Viva Topics will be retired. \n</p><p>The following premium Viva Topics experiences and lightweight topics management experiences will no longer be available in Viva Engage, including: \n</p><ul><li>Viewing Viva Topics card when hovering on a topic \n</li><li>Viewing or using AI-discovered Viva Topics \n</li><li>Links to Viva Topics pages \n</li><li>Topic management via Viva Topics or lightweight topics management \n</li><li>Featuring of topics in Answers \n</li></ul><p>Using Engage topics, users will continue to be able to create topics, add topics to posts, follow topics, edit topics they created, and increase the relevance of their feeds by following topics.

Tenants using legacy topics in Viva Engage will begin migrations in September 2024 and migrations will continue until all Native mode networks have been completed.</p><p> \n</p><p><b>Why is this change happening?</b> \n</p><p>As a result of the retirement of Viva Topics, Viva Engage will retire the integration with Viva Topics, but continue to support a simplified topics model to help organize, amplify, route, and recall knowledge posted with topics. To ensure customer data is retained we will migrate customer topics data from Viva Topics into Viva Engage to preserve topics applied to posts and associated Engage topic metadata such as followers, description and creator. \n</p><p>During the transition, we will stop topics migrations to use Viva Topics and Topics lightweight management but continue by-request migrations that enable Viva Engage networks to use Answers in Viva (<a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/viva/engage/eac-answers-overview-set-up#technical-requirements\" target=\"_blank\">Technical requirements</a>).

Due to this, the attachments currently do not show up with the Engage messages in the eDiscovery review sets.

Going forward, instead of the link to the location in Engage backend, we will ingest the link to the SharePoint site location where the attachment is stored. As a result, this link will open the attachment from its SharePoint location. There are several benefits to this solution enhancement:<br></p><ol><li>aligns Engage with other products (such as Teams) in terms of eDiscovery data access.\n</li><li>streamlines how attachments within a conversation show up as nested items under that conversation in the review set, making it easier for analysis as well as export.\n</li><li>displays the correct name of the attachments (consistent with as it is shown in review set) when retrieved through SharePoint location.\n</li><li>is more robust, scalable, and reliable for electronic discovery purposes.&nbsp;</li></ol><p><img src=\"https://img-prod-cms-rt-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/cms/api/am/imageFileData/RW1mIHs?ver=8ac0\" style=\"width: 400px;\"><br></p><p>Once the solution is GA, any new Engage message with attachment that is ingested to eDiscovery will have the SharePoint links to the attachments with them (instead of Engage links). This will not change anything with the records that have already been ingested to eDiscovery.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Please do take note of the following scenarios:\n</p><ol><li>An existing message in a conversation is edited (content is edited, but attachment is unchanged\n</li><li>An existing message in a conversation is edited, along with the attachments (attachment is updated or new attachment is added)\n</li><li>A new message with an attachment is posted in an existing conversation.\n</li></ol><p>In all the above scenarios, any new version of the messages will be ingested to eDiscovery with the SharePoint links to the attachments.

      "Content": "<p>Updated June 13, 2024: We have updated the timing of this change below. Thank you for your patience.</p><p>Yammer is committed to strengthening the alignment of Yammer to Microsoft 365. This means we will no longer support tenants having more than one non-external Yammer network. This change will ensure Yammer networks have the same organizational boundaries as their corresponding Microsoft 365 tenants.\n</p><p><i>Why is this happening now?\n</i></p><p>Integrating Yammer more fully into the Microsoft 365 ecosystem has been a multi-year effort. New 1:many configurations have not been permitted since October 2018. All new Yammer networks provisioned after January 2020 have been created in Native Mode. In September 2022, <a href=\"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/yammer-blog/non-native-and-hybrid-yammer-networks-are-being-upgraded/ba-p/3612915\" target=\"_blank\">the enforcement of Native Mode was announced</a>. Automated network consolidation is an important prerequisite to reaching Native Mode and gaining access to broader safety, security, and compliance features. \n</p><p><b>When this will happen:</b>\n</p><p>Starting on May 1, 2023 and continuing through January 1, 2025. You are welcome to initiate network consolidation on your own at any time before or after May 1, 2023.\n</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b>\n</p><p>With automated network consolidation, you will lose access to all your secondary Yammer networks. Users from your secondary Yammer networks will be migrated to your primary network, but <b><i><u>groups and data will be lost.</u></i></b> In advance of this change, we strongly recommend that customers perform a full data export of their networks. You can read more about exporting data from your network <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/yammer/manage-security-and-compliance/export-yammer-enterprise-data\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.\n</p><p>It is strongly advised that customers <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/yammer/configure-your-yammer-network/faq-consolidate-multiple-yammer-networks\" target=\"_blank\">perform this network consolidation themselves</a>.  This will allow you to choose the time of the consolidation and allow the administrator to choose which primary domain will be associated with the remaining network.\n</p><p>There are Microsoft partners that can help you migrate data from your secondary networks. Please reach out to your Microsoft Account Team or <a href=\"https://products.office.com/yammer/partners\" target=\"_blank\">contact a partner</a> for more information.\n</p><p>Post-consolidation of the networks into 1:1 alignment with Microsoft 365, they will be upgraded to Native Mode. This provides access to the latest features in Yammer and ensures that Yammer and Viva Engage content is included in Microsoft Purview's compliance and security features.\n</p><p>You can read more about our plans to ensure alignment to Native Mode <a href=\"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/yammer-blog/non-native-and-hybrid-yammer-networks-are-being-upgraded/ba-p/3612915\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.\n</p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b>\n</p><p><i>If you would like to self-initiate your network consolidation:\n</i></p><ul><li>There is a guide to network consolidation available to walk you through the process. A network administrator can run the network migration tool from within Yammer.\n</li></ul><p><i>If you would like Microsoft to initiate your network consolidation:\n</i></p><ul><li>You are not required to take any action. Microsoft will notify you via the M365 Message Center of your scheduled consolidation date and default primary network and domain. The network with the highest total message count will be the default primary network. \n</li><li>If you would like a different default primary network, contact Microsoft 365 support to log an exception.\n</li></ul><p><i>If you need to postpone or schedule network consolidation around blackout dates:\n</i></p><ul><li>Contact Microsoft 365 support to log an exception.  \n</li></ul><p><br></p>",

We will communicate via Message center when we are ready to proceed.</p><p style=\"margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:7.5pt;margin-left:0in\">Today, we are announcing that, beginning in January 2025, Exchange Online will begin enforcing an external recipient rate limit of 2000 recipients in 24 hours.</p><p>Exchange Online does not support bulk or high-volume transactional email. We have not enforced limiting of bulk email until now, but we plan on doing so with the introduction of an External Recipient Rate (ERR) limit. The ERR limit is being introduced to help reduce unfair usage and abuse of Exchange Online resources.</p><p><b>When this will happen:</b></p><p>The new ERR limit will be introduced in 2 phases:</p><ul><li>Phase 1 - Starting January 1, 2025, the limit will apply to cloud-hosted mailboxes of all newly created tenants.</li><li>Phase 2 - Between July and December 2025, we will start applying the limit to cloud-hosted mailboxes of existing tenants.</li></ul><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b></p><p>Exchange Online enforces a Recipient Rate limit of 10000 recipients for cloud-hosted mailboxes. The 2000 ERR limit will become a sublimit within this 10000 Recipient Rate limit. There is no change to the Recipient Rate limit, and both of these will be rolling limits for 24-hour windows. You can send to up to 2,000 external recipients in a 24-hour period, and if you max out the external recipient rate limit then you will still be able to send to up to 8,000 internal recipients in that same period. If you don't send to any external recipients in a 24-hour period, you can send to up to 10,000 internal recipients.</p><p>For example:\n</p><ul><li>You use a cloud-hosted mailbox to send to 1,000 external recipients and 2,000 internal recipients at 6:00AM on Day 1, for a total of 3,000 recipients. You then send to another 1,000 external recipients at 8:00AM on Day 1. Because you sent to 2,000 external recipients, you will be blocked from sending to external recipients until 6:00AM on Day 2. During this period, you are able to send to up to 6,000 internal recipients, but for this example, let's assume that you don't.\n</li><li>At 6:00AM on Day 2, the 1,000 external recipients and 2,000 internal recipients sent at 6:00AM on Day 1 will no longer count toward the 24-hour limit calculation. Thus, from 6:00-8:00AM on Day 2, you can send to up to 9,000 total recipients (e.g., 9,000 internal or 8,000 internal plus 1,000 external).\n</li><li>If you don't send to any internal or external recipients during this period, then at 8:00AM on Day 2 you can again send to 10,000 recipients total with up to 2,000 of them being external recipients.</li></ul><p>\n</p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b><br></p><p>If you have a cloud-hosted mailbox that needs to exceed the ERR limit, you can move to <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/communication-services/concepts/email/email-overview\" target=\"_blank\">Azure Communication Services for Email</a>, which is designed specifically for high volume email sent to recipients external to your tenant.</p>",

We have concluded  through  customer feedback that this change to our initial deprecation plan, by maintaining support   for Live Events, will empower customers to produce large events as established and provide more time to upgrade to town hall, our new digital streaming event solution for large events, on their own schedule. Town hall will continue to serve as the platform where we will deliver new product value to our customers.</p><p>Teams Live Events will continue to be supported. We want to ensure that customers can upgrade to town hall on their own schedule as we work to bring new features and capabilities to town hall.  Town  hall is already available for commercial customers in public clouds, and we are adding new features regularly.</p><p>If you are using Teams Live Events for your large-scale digital events, you can continue to do so past the previously announced deprecation date of September 30th, 2024. However, we encourage you to try town hall, which offers a more modern and interactive experience for your live events.&nbsp;</p><p>You don't need to do anything at this time to continue using Teams Live Events. If you have directed your organization to not schedule Live Events after September due to the deprecation announcement, you may now schedule Live Events past September 2024.  For more information please refer to our blog post regarding this announcement:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-teams-blog/updates-for-town-hall-in-microsoft-teams-and-teams-live-events/ba-p/4148352\" target=\"_blank\">Updates for Town Hall in Microsoft Teams and Teams Live Events</a>.</p><p>&nbsp;---Original message below for reference---</p><p>With the introduction of Town halls in Microsoft Teams, Teams Live Events will be retired for commercial customers on September 30, 2024. This provides commercial customers with a 12-month window to prepare for the retirement and transition off Teams Live Events.&nbsp;</p><p><b>When this will happen:</b></p><p>September 30, 2024</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b></p><p>After September 30, 2024, Teams Live Events will no longer be supported, and access will be discontinued. Customers will not be able to schedule, start, or join any events on Teams Live Events after this date. Existing recordings will be available to access until December 31, 2024. If customers want to retain any recordings from prior events, they will need to download the recordings and upload them to a different location before December 31, 2024. Between now and September 2024, customers can continue to use Teams Live Events with no change in their existing experience. However, our recommendation is that customers (both existing and new) transition to and start to use town halls as it becomes generally available on October 5, 2023.</p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b></p><p>To prepare your organization for the transition we advise:\n</p><ul><li>Start to use town hall as it becomes generally available on October 5.</li><li>Learn more about town hall when documentation becomes available on adoption.microsoft.com and learn.microsoft.com on October 5.</li><li>Start planning to download recordings your organization wishes to retain before December 31, 2024.</li></ul><p><br></p>",

Thank you for your patience.</p><p>Non-Native and Hybrid Microsoft Viva Engage (formerly Yammer) Networks will be upgraded to Native Mode to allow users, groups, and content to be compatible with and mapped to their counterparts in Azure Active Directory and Microsoft 365. Native Mode also provides other benefits, such as the ability to host Live Events in every Viva Engage community and simplify file administration through SharePoint. Most critically, Native Mode supports eDiscovery through the Microsoft Purview compliance portal, allowing your organization to collaborate safely and securely within your Viva Engage network. 90% of Viva Engage networks are in Native Mode today, including our top 10 largest networks.<br></p><p><b>When this will happen:</b></p><p>We will begin migrating networks on December 01, 2022, and continue the upgrades through late December 2024 (previously January). The process will begin with smaller networks. If you prefer to control the timing of your upgrade, you may initiate the process on your own at any time by visiting the Microsoft 365 Native Mode page within the Network Admin pages of Viva Engage.\n</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b></p><p>You will lose access to the following features:\n</p><ul><li>Network-level guests \n</li><li>Email blocked lists\n</li><li>Secret groups\n</li></ul><p>If your organization has active guest users, <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/yammer/get-started-with-yammer/azure-ad-b2b-guests-yammer\" target=\"_blank\">Azure Active Directory B2B guest functionality</a> can be used for guests who reside in the same geography as the Viva Engage network (US guests for US networks; EU guests for EU networks). Guests will need to be reinvited to your network.\n</p><p>If your organization currently uses an email blocked list to manage access to your Viva Engage network, you can continue to manage access from the Azure Active Directory Portal.

No specific user action is required. Links to the previous domains are backwards compatible and continue to be supported. Users may notice that the new application domains are lacking the “.com” extension.

In addition, Stream (on SharePoint) also enables you and your users to:\n</p><ul><li>Easily manage video files with the same security, admin controls, multi-geo support, compliance (eDiscovery, legal hold, retention, and data loss prevention policies), permissions, and sharing controls as the rest of your files in SharePoint and OneDrive.\n</li><li>Record videos with advanced tools directly in the camera like background blur or replace, inking, text, audio only, and teleprompter.\n</li><li>Search for videos anywhere in Microsoft 365. You can now find videos and Teams meeting recordings across Microsoft 365 by searching keywords.\n</li><li>Find what you need quickly on the Stream start page in Office. The new start page shows recent, shared, and favorite videos, with playlists coming soon. (Note: The Stream start page doesn't show you videos in Stream (Classic).)\n</li><li>View Teams Meeting Recordings with transcripts, chapters, timeline markers, speaker attribution, and comments.\n</li><li>Create custom page, site, and portal experiences to feature videos as part of your intranet and Viva Connections.\n</li><li>Share videos the same way you would any other file in Microsoft 365 with support for Guests, People in your Organization links, or unauthenticated external sharing with “anyone” links.\n</li><li>Get analytics per video, for all the videos in a site, or see who has watched your video.\n</li><li>Add videos to the Viva Connections Feed.\n</li><li>Use APIs based on the Microsoft Graph Files API for basic video file operations.\n</li><li>These benefits add up to ease of video management for admins and more productivity for your teams.</li></ul>",

To support your move to Stream (on SharePoint) we have created migration tool that allows you to transfer your videos to SharePoint while also bringing over metadata, links and permissions associated with your videos.</p><p>\n</p><p>To begin using the migration tool please refer to our 3-part Migration guide here: <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/stream/streamnew/stream-migration-guide-part1\" target=\"_blank\">Guide to migrate data from Stream (Classic) to Stream (on SharePoint) - Part 1</a></p><p><b>How this affects your organization:</b></p><p>\n</p><p>Stream (on SharePoint) brings your users many of the capabilities of Stream (Classic) while allowing them to record and play videos directly in many everyday work and school apps such as Teams, Office.com, Yammer, Viva, PowerPoint, and SharePoint. In addition, Stream (on SharePoint) also enables you and your users to:\n</p><ul><li>Easily manage video files with the same security, admin controls, multi-geo support, compliance (eDiscovery, legal hold, retention, and data loss prevention policies), permissions, and sharing controls as the rest of your files in SharePoint and OneDrive.\n</li><li>Record videos with advanced tools directly in the camera like background blur or replace, inking, text, audio only, and teleprompter.\n</li><li>Search for videos anywhere in Microsoft 365. You can now find videos and Teams meeting recordings across Microsoft 365 by searching keywords.\n</li><li>Find what you need quickly on the Stream start page in Office. The new start page shows recent, shared, and favorite videos, with playlists coming soon. (Note: The Stream start page doesn't show you videos in Stream (Classic).)\n</li><li>View Teams Meeting Recordings with transcripts, chapters, timeline markers, speaker attribution, and comments.\n</li><li>Create custom page, site, and portal experiences to feature videos as part of your intranet and Viva Connections.\n</li><li>Share videos the same way you would any other file in Microsoft 365 with support for Guests, People in your Organization links, or unauthenticated external sharing with “anyone” links.\n</li><li>Get analytics per video, for all the videos in a site, or see who has watched your video.\n</li><li>Add videos to the Viva Connections Feed.\n</li><li>Use APIs based on the Microsoft Graph Files API for basic video file operations.\n</li></ul><p>These benefits add up to ease of video management for admins and more productivity for your teams.</p><p><b>Learn more:</b></p><p>\n</p><p>Below are links to more information about migration and Stream (on SharePoint):\n</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://aka.ms/StreamMigration\" target=\"_blank\">Stream retirement and timeline</a> overview and migration tool details.\n</li><li>Settings to <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/stream/streamnew/migration-settings#save-videos-to-stream-on-sharepoint\" target=\"_blank\">delay Stream (Classic) disablement</a>\n</li><li>IT admin <a href=\"https://aka.ms/NewStream\" target=\"_blank\">overview of Stream (on SharePoint)</a>\n</li><li>Stream (on SharePoint) <a href=\"https://aka.ms/StreamAdoption\" target=\"_blank\">adoption</a> and <a href=\"https://aka.ms/StreamUserGuide\" target=\"_blank\">end user guides.</a>\n</li><li><a href=\"https://aka.ms/StreamClassicToSPFeatureList\" target=\"_blank\">Stream (Classic) to Stream (on SharePoint) comparison</a></li></ul>",

This change also applies to the EWS SDKs for Java and .NET, as well.\n</p><p>Despite this announcement, EWS is still available and supported for use in production environments. But we strongly suggest migrating to Microsoft Graph to access Exchange Online data and gain access to the latest features and functionality.\n</p><p>Today’s announcement and the retirement of EWS apply only to Microsoft 365 and Exchange Online (all environments); there are no changes to EWS in Exchange Server. Further, the changes in Exchange Online do not affect Outlook for Windows or Mac, Teams, or any other Microsoft product.\n</p><p>Migrating Applications to Microsoft Graph\n</p><p>We know there are several feature gaps between EWS and Microsoft Graph, and though the list below is not exhaustive, these are the gaps most frequently reported to us by developers:\n</p><ul><li>Access to Archive Mailboxes – We are working on delivering access to archive mailboxes via Microsoft Graph and will provide an updated timeline in the coming months.\n</li><li>Folder Associated Information / User Configuration – We are working on these features and will provide an updated timeline in the coming months.\n</li><li>Exchange Online Management – We are investigating solutions for this and will provide an updated timeline in the coming months.\n</li><li>Access to Public Folders – We are reviewing the need to provide third-party app access to Exchange Online public folders via the Graph API and are interested in hearing from customers and partners who build solutions that use public folders, other than backup and restore solutions. If you are willing to share details on how you use EWS with public folders, we’d love to hear from you, and you can reach us at <a href=\"mailto:EWSandPFfeedback@microsoft.com\" target=\"_blank\">EWSandPFfeedback@microsoft.com</a>.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>We know there are other gaps not listed above, and we continue to work on closing them, but it’s possible some functionality will not make it to Microsoft Graph. We encourage you to provide feedback to us, keep a close eye on the <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/graph/whats-new-overview\" target=\"_blank\">What’s new in Microsoft Graph</a> page, and explore alternatives for functionality or features not available in Microsoft Graph.\n</p><p>Next Steps\n</p><p>The retirement of these APIs follows our <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/lifecycle/policies/modern\" target=\"_blank\">Modern Lifecycle Policy</a>. We understand changes like this may cause some inconvenience, but we are confident it will ensure more secure, reliable, and performant experiences.\n</p><p>We will publish regular communications as we progress towards this deadline to aid affected tenants in identifying EWS usage. We encourage all customers to monitor Message Center and this blog for related content.\n</p><p>Thank you in advance for updating and opening your apps to a wider range of useful and intelligent features on Microsoft Graph. We are extremely excited about the growing opportunities that Microsoft Graph offers to developers, and we remain fully committed to our journey to empower developers to access Microsoft 365 data with the most modern features and tools.</p>",

The new <a href=\"https://aka.ms/NewTeams\" target=\"_blank\">Microsoft Teams desktop app</a> is built on a foundation of speed, performance, and flexibility—saving you time and helping your organization work together more efficiently.  \n</p><p style=\"\"><b>How will this benefit my organization:</b></p><p style=\"\">Our goal for the new Teams app is to make it twice as fast while using half the system resources. We aren’t done optimizing the performance of new Teams, but we are already seeing common scenarios such as app load and meeting join hit that goal, as well as a 50% reduction in memory.  We have also observed significant gains in installation time, disk space used, chat and channel switch time, search, and more.\n</p><p style=\"\">The new Teams app also adds support for organizations that have multiple tenants and users who must manage multiple accounts. Users can be signed into multiple tenants and accounts simultaneously and receive notifications no matter which one is currently in use.\n</p><p style=\"\"><b>Note:</b> Not all customer segments (Education, Special Cloud, GCC, GCC-High and DoD) and platforms (Mac, VDI, and Web) will receive this update at this time. While the new Teams preview includes much of the same functionality as classic Teams, there are a few features which are not yet available. Visit this <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/new-teams-desktop-admin\" target=\"_blank\">page</a> to learn more about what’s currently available and what’s coming up.\n</p><p style=\"\"><b>How will I preview the new Teams experience:</b></p><ul><li>If you are in the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/public-preview-doc-updates\" target=\"_blank\">public preview program</a>, you will have access to the <i>Try the new Teams toggle</i>.
