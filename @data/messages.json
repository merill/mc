Thank you for your patience.</p><p><b>Introduction\n</b></p><p>We’re introducing a new Workflows experience in Microsoft Teams that is rebuilt from the ground up based on feedback.&nbsp;</p><p>The Workflows app helps you automate repetitive tasks and streamline everyday processes across Teams and Microsoft 365. Whether you're scheduling messages, managing approvals, syncing updates across apps, or triggering actions from chat messages, Workflows makes it easy to build automations in just a few clicks. It’s powered by Power Automate and designed to help you stay focused on what matters most.</p><p>This new version addresses previous concerns around complexity and performance, delivering a faster, more intuitive, and streamlined interface. With the updated experience, users can now create powerful automations in three steps or fewer.</p><p>This release is part of our broader effort to make automation more accessible and impactful for every information worker. Whether you're new to automation or a seasoned pro, the new Workflows app is designed to meet you where you work—and help you get more done with less effort.

Thank you for your patience.</p><p>As outlined in MC677236 (July 2024), Azure to OneDrive migration of existing Whiteboards has now started and will reach your tenant (if you haven’t received it already) in the coming months, before June 2025. Complete details can be found in this support article: <a href=\"https://support.microsoft.com/office/migration-of-whiteboards-from-azure-to-onedrive-6ddc6df1-540e-4b70-8e6a-541fafdc24f4\" target=\"_blank\">Migration of Whiteboards from Azure to OneDrive - Microsoft Support</a>.\n</p><p><i>Action for admins</i>: The migration affects only Microsoft Azure-based Whiteboards. If your tenant does not have any Azure Whiteboards, this migration does not impact you. Check if your tenant has Azure Whiteboards using this PowerShell cmdlet: <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/module/whiteboard/get-whiteboardsfortenant?view=whiteboard-ps\" target=\"_blank\">- Get-WhiteboardsForTenant</a>\n</p><p><i>Action item for users:</i> Until the migration completes. When your tenant receives the migration code, users can trigger a migration by starting a Whiteboard session from a web browser by simply going to <a href=\"https://whiteboard.microsoft.com/\" target=\"_blank\">https://whiteboard.microsoft.com/</a> or by using a Whiteboard in their Teams meetings.</p><p>Whiteboard previously stored whiteboard files in Azure storage. In 2022, Whiteboard switched to OneDrive as the storage location for most newly created boards. We made a client-based migration available for your organization, which is currently rolling out gradually.&nbsp;</p><p>This message is associated with Microsoft 365 Roadmap ID <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?filters=&amp;searchterms=117394%2C\" target=\"_blank\">117394</a>.\n</p><p><b>When this will happen</b>\n</p><p>The client-based migration experience started in December 2024 (previously July), and we expect to complete the migration by early August 2025 (previously early June).</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization</b>\n</p><p>Any user who launches an eligible Whiteboard client (Whiteboard on Windows, Whiteboard in Teams desktop/web) will automatically kick off a non-blocking migration of all their whiteboards. Depending on how many whiteboards they have, on average the process will take between a few seconds to a few minutes.\n</p><p>The migration will provide many benefits for your organization and users on the migrated boards, including:\n</p><ul><li>Features unique to whiteboards stored in OneDrive, such as Follow, Commenting, and more.\n</li><li>Improved performance on whiteboards now stored in OneDrive.\n</li><li>Improved compliance and security associated with whiteboard being stored in OneDrive.\n</li></ul><p>There is no possibility to delay the migration.\n</p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare</b>\n</p><p>The migration will happen naturally and automatically for most users in your organization with no disruption, but please ensure that users are aware they need to launch Whiteboard in one of the previously mentioned clients in order to keep their content prior to the conclusion of the migration.\n</p><p>In the unlikely case that a user’s whiteboards fail to migrate, they will see an error banner. We will attempt to migrate the board again in 30 days. If the board contains important information, we recommend the user copy the content to a new whiteboard.\n</p><p>Users will be able to see which boards have not migrated in a dedicated section on the board picker. Admins will be able to verify what whiteboard content remains in Azure and obtain the userIDs via our PowerShell cmdlets, if you wish to proactively notify users to get their content.\n</p><p>Complete details about the migration can be found in <a href=\"https://support.microsoft.com/office/migration-of-whiteboards-from-azure-to-onedrive-6ddc6df1-540e-4b70-8e6a-541fafdc24f4\" target=\"_blank\">Migration of Whiteboards from Azure to OneDrive - Microsoft Support</a>, including how start and completion of migration will be notified, how errors will be communicated, and the new PowerShell cmdlets.</p>",

Thank you for your patience.</p><p>As part of our ongoing efforts to enhance performance and scalability, Microsoft Defender for Office 365 investigation and hunting experiences are undergoing a data platform migration to establish a more robust, efficient, and scalable data storage system. This migration aims to improve data consistency and reliability, particularly in investigation and threat-hunting experiences.\n</p><p><b>When this will happen:</b>\n</p><p>General Availability (Worldwide, GCC, GCC High, DoD): We began rolling out this migration and Phase 1 of performance improvement early November 2024 and was completed in late June 2025.</p><p>The rollout of Phase 2 of performance improvement is targeted for end December 2025.</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b></p><p><i>Key benefits</i></p><ul><li><i>Ensures data consistency across multiple user experiences: </i>By consolidating data management under a unified platform, this migration will eliminate discrepancies between different workflows, ensuring that security analysts have access to consistent and reliable data across various investigation and hunting experiences.\n</li><li><i>Establishes data parity between Threat Explorer and Advanced Hunting: </i>By leveraging a single, unified data source, the migration will ensure that data retrieved in Threat Explorer and Advanced Hunting remains synchronized. This reduces the chances of data disparity between different tools and allows security teams to conduct investigations with better accuracy.\n</li><li><i>Enhances the data pipeline for Advanced Hunting, resulting in improved performance and accuracy</i>: The migration will optimize data ingestion pipeline and proactive monitoring system of Advanced Hunting. This will lead to improved data freshness and reduce the chances of potential data quality issues in data pipeline.\n</li><li><i>Accelerates development cycles for new features built on the new data platform: </i>The modernized data architecture will enable faster iteration and deployment of new features. By reducing dependencies on legacy systems and adopting a scalable infrastructure, Microsoft can introduce feature enhancements more rapidly, bringing greater value to security analysts.\n</li><li><i>Strengthens proactive monitoring capabilities to minimize potential impact on customer workflows:</i> The new platform will enhance real-time monitoring and alerting mechanisms, allowing for proactive detection and resolution of issues before they impact user workflows. Improved observability will ensure that any latency or disruptions are identified early, reducing downtime and improving system reliability.</li></ul><p><i>Potential impact</i></p><ul><li>No direct impact on customer data.\n</li><li>While the new platform brings significant improvements, users may experience slight delays in data availability (such as email metadata and post-delivery actions like quarantine release and manual remediation) in certain experiences, including Threat Explorer, Email Entity, and the Email Summary Panel.\n</li><li>In some cases, users may encounter intermittent failures for brief moment when loading the Email Summary Panel from experiences such as Quarantine and Submission immediately after an email is delivered. However, this will automatically resolve once the necessary data has been processed and stored.</li></ul><p><i>Resolution plan</i></p><p>While our team works on the migration, we are also actively working on optimizing the performance of the new data platform to align as closely as possible with the data freshness rate of Threat Explorer before the data platform migration. Also, efforts are underway to minimize failure rates across user experiences caused by temporary data unavailability.\n</p><p>The phase 1 performance improvement work was completed in late June 2025. After that, our teams are continuously monitoring the latencies and investing in further improvements to ensure seamless security operations experience to end users.</p><p>Phase 2 of the performance improvement plan is targeted to further improve the data freshness rate and is expected to complete by end of December 2025.</p><p>This change will be available by default.</p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b></p><p>This migration will happen automatically by the specified dates with no admin action required before the rollout.

This new integration leverages DLM features to provide an additional control for Adaptive protection that automatically preserves items deleted by a user with an elevated risk level, so items can be restored if needed.</p><p>This message is associated with Microsoft 365 Roadmap ID <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?filters=&amp;searchterms=392839\" target=\"_blank\">392839</a>.\n</p><p><b>When this will happen:</b>\n</p><p>Public preview: We will begin rolling out in late June 2024 (previously early May) and expect to complete by late July 2024 (previously mid-July).\n</p><p>General Availability:&nbsp; We will begin rolling out early February 2026 and expect to complete by late February 2026.</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b>\n</p><p>After the rollout, and after you enable Adaptive protection for your tenant, the retention label and auto-apply policy for data lifecycle management will be automatically created for you. This policy will automatically include elevated risk users identified by Microsoft Purview | Insider Risk Management solution. If these users delete content from Microsoft SharePoint, Microsoft OneDrive, or Microsoft Exchange, a retention label is automatically applied to that content to retain it for 120 days. Retention labels are automatically applied to unlabeled content deleted by these users. When these users are no longer at the elevated risk level, they are automatically removed from the DLM policy, and the system will no longer keep a copy of content they delete. Any content copies previously retained when the user had an elevated risk level will be kept for the 120 days as specified by the retention label.\n</p><p>Unlike other retention labeling scenarios, users do not see the retention label, and you do not need to create or manage the retention label or policy. At this time, you can't change the retention period or assign different policies based on the different risk levels, or for different locations. The single retention label and auto-labeling policy for your tenant is not visible in the Microsoft Purview compliance portal.</p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b>\n</p><p>Learn more: <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/purview/retention#dynamically-mitigate-the-risk-of-accidental-or-malicious-deletes\" target=\"_blank\">Learn about retention policies &amp; labels to retain or delete | Microsoft Learn</a>\n</p><p>If you're using Adaptive protection and want to automatically retain content deleted by elevated risk users, follow these steps to turn on this new integration.\n</p><ol><li>Sign in to the <a href=\"https://compliance.microsoft.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Microsoft Purview compliance portal</a>.\n</li><li>Navigate to <i>Data lifecycle management &gt; Microsoft 365 &gt; Adaptive protection settings</i> in the top right corner.\n</li><li>Turn the setting ON and select <i>Save</i>.\n</li></ol><p>\n</p><p><img src=\"https://cxcs.microsoft.net/file/messagecenter/en-us/fe6a20ed-77ce-44ce-b862-bc7f4b78b93e\" style=\"width: 400px;\" alt=\"admin settings\">\n</p><p><img src=\"https://cxcs.microsoft.net/file/messagecenter/en-us/521b359c-13a9-41ef-ad96-215789a32eb3\" style=\"width: 400px;\" alt=\"admin settings\">\n</p><p>If you’re not using Adaptive protection already, turn on Adaptive protection and the new feature will be enabled along with Adaptive protection.\n</p><p>This rollout will happen automatically by the specified date with no admin action required before the rollout.

Thank you for your patience.</p><p>As part of the Microsoft Secure Future Initiative (SFI) and in alignment with the “Secure by Default” principle, we are updating default settings in Microsoft 365 to help you meet the minimum security benchmark and harden your tenant’s security posture. These changes target legacy authentication protocols and app access permissions that may expose organizations to unnecessary risk.\n</p><p>This is the first step in a broader effort to evaluate and evolve Microsoft 365 defaults through the lens of security best practices.\n</p><p><b>When this will happen:</b></p><p>These changes will begin rolling out in mid-July 2025 and are expected to complete by August 2025.\n</p><p><b>How this affects your organization</b></p><p>The following settings will be updated:</p><table class=\"table table-bordered\"><tbody><tr><td>Settings</td><td>Impact</td></tr><tr><td>Block legacy browser authentication to SharePoint and OneDrive using RPS (Relying Party Suite)</td><td>Legacy authentication protocols like RPS (Relying Party Suite) are vulnerable to brute-force and phishing attacks due to non-modern authentication. Blocking this prevents applications that are using outdated methods from accessing SharePoint and OneDrive via browser. To use PowerShell to block legacy browser authentication, see <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.online.sharepoint.powershell/set-spotenant?view=sharepoint-ps#-legacybrowserauthprotocolsenabled\" target=\"_blank\">Set-SPOTenant</a>.</td></tr><tr><td>Block FPRPC (FrontPage Remote Procedure Call) protocol for Office file opens</td><td>FrontPage Remote Procedure Call (FPRPC) is a legacy protocol used for remote web page authoring. While no longer widely used, Legacy protocols such as FPRPC can be more susceptible to compromise and blocking FPRPC helps reduce exposure to vulnerabilities. With this change, FPRPC will be blocked for opening files, preventing the use of this non-modern protocol in Microsoft 365 clients. To learn how to block the FPRPC protocol, see <a href=\"https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2324509\" target=\"_blank\">turn on web content filtering</a>.</td></tr><tr><td>Require admin consent for third-party apps accessing files and sites</td><td><p>Users allowing third-party apps to access file and site content can lead to overexposure of an organization’s content. Requiring admins to consent to this access can help reduce overexposure. With this change,  Microsoft managed <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/enterprise-apps/manage-app-consent-policies\" target=\"_blank\">App Consent Policies</a> will be enabled, and users will be unable to consent to third party applications accessing their files and sites by default. Instead, they can request administrators to consent on their behalf. To configure admin consent, follow instructions here: <a href=\"https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2324703\" target=\"_blank\">Configuring the Admin Consent workflow</a>. Customers who have already blocked user consent, turned on our previously recommended consent settings, or applied custom user consent settings will not be affected by this change.<br>Admins can also configure granular app access policies, such as limiting user access to the application for specific users or groups. Learn more <a href=\"https://aka.ms/entra-app-access\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.<br></p></td></tr></tbody></table><p>These changes are on by default and apply to all Microsoft 365 tenants. No additional licensing is required.\n</p><p><b>What you can do to prepare:</b></p><p>We recommend the following actions:\n</p><ul><li><b>Assess current configurations:</b> As applicable, identify current configurations for <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/sharepoint-online/set-spotenant?view=sharepoint-ps#-legacybrowserauthprotocolsenabled\" target=\"_blank\">RPS </a>or <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/module/sharepoint-online/set-spotenant?view=sharepoint-ps\" target=\"_blank\">FPRPC</a> protocols.</li><li><b>Notify stakeholders: </b>Inform IT admins, app owners, and security teams about the upcoming changes.\n</li><li><b>Update documentation: </b>Ensure internal guidance reflects the new defaults and admin consent process.\n</li><li><b>Configure Admin Consent workflow:</b> If third party apps access is applicable for your organization, learn how to set up the workflow: <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/enterprise-apps/configure-admin-consent-workflow\" target=\"_blank\">Configuring admin consent workflow.</a></li></ul><p>Additional considerations\n</p><ul><li>Does the change alter how existing customer data is processed, stored, or accessed?

Thank you for your patience.\n</p><p>We are introducing a new Startup Boost task from the Microsoft Office installer to optimize performance and load-time of experiences within Office applications. &nbsp;After the system performs the task, the app remains in a paused state until the app launches and the sequence resumes, or the system removes the app from memory to reclaim resources. The system can perform this task for an app after a device reboot and periodically as system conditions allow.</p><p><b>When this will happen:</b></p><p>General Availability (Worldwide, GCC, GCC High, DoD): We will begin rolling out late June 2025 (previously late May) and expect to complete by late September 2025 (previously late July).</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b></p><p>New tasks will be publicly visible in the Windows Task Scheduler.&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Task Names: Office Startup Boost and Office Startup Boost Logon.</li><li>Task Description: This task ensures that Office applications can take advantage of preloading performance enhancements.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>Initial roll-out will be on Microsoft Word. We have no announcements to make at this time regarding support for additional applications.</p><p>Startup Boost is only available when your PC has enough resources to run without impacting system performance. This includes having at least 8 GB of available RAM, and at least 5 GB of available disk space. When Startup Boost is active, the scheduled task will not run immediately at login to avoid slowing down your PC — it will wait 10 minutes to ensure the system is in a steady idle state. Additionally, Startup Boost will be disabled when Energy Saver mode is active. Startup Boost only runs if you have launched Word recently, and if you have not launched Word recently it will automatically disable itself.</p><p>Startup Boost is an optional performance feature. It is safe to disable. When disabled, Microsoft Office applications will be fully functional but may take longer to load. Customers can disable Startup Boost entirely by preventing the process from starting. To disable the feature, use the in-app setting, e.g., <i>Word &gt; Options &gt; General &gt; Startup Boost (under Start up Options)</i>.</p><p>Scheduled task entry in Task Scheduler:</p><p><img src=\"https://cxcs.microsoft.net/file/ccp/en-us/da011aba-1d94-42a5-8bb7-507075d26620\" style=\"width: 450px;\"></p><p><br></p><p>End-user UI to enable/disable Startup Boost in Word:</p><p><img src=\"https://cxcs.microsoft.net/file/ccp/en-us/e038abb2-c032-48ed-a891-5bfcba1bad8e\" style=\"width: 450px;\"><br></p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b></p><p>This rollout will happen automatically with no admin action required.&nbsp;</p><p>You can disable this Startup Boost task like any other scheduled task. Please note that Office Installer will automatically recreate all scheduled tasks when it applies an update, so users who disable this task will need to disable it again after an Office update. Admins can disable this feature via Group Policy without needing to do so after each Office update.</p>",

With IRR, admins can configure accepted domains to route messages directly to a designated geo-region, ensuring that email data is processed and stored entirely within the recipient’s region—even if it differs from the tenant’s primary location. This helps organizations meet compliance requirements without compromising email delivery performance.</p><p>This message is associated with Microsoft 365 Roadmap ID <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?filters=&amp;searchterms=410245\" target=\"_blank\">410245</a>.</p><p><b>When this will happen:</b></p><p>Public Preview: We will begin rolling out in early August 2025 and expect to complete by end of August 2025.</p><p>General Availability (Worldwide): We expect to begin rolling out in early October 2025 and expect to complete by late October 2025.</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b></p><p>In-Region Routing (IRR) is disabled by default. If you do not plan to use this feature, no action is required.</p><p>For domains where you choose to enable IRR, the feature allows you to route inbound emails to accepted domains associated with specific geo-regions. When these domains are aligned with users located in the same geo-region, emails are fully processed and stored within the recipient’s region. This ensures that data remains within the user’s Preferred Data Location (PDL), supporting stronger data sovereignty and compliance with regional regulations.</p><p>If your organization uses Microsoft Purview capabilities such as Data Loss Prevention (DLP), retention policies, or eDiscovery, you may need to review and adjust those policies to ensure they align with the new regional routing behavior.</p><p></p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b></p><ul><li>Ensure that admins have the necessary permissions to manage accepted domains and access to either Exchange Online PowerShell or to the Microsoft 365 admin center.</li><li>Review your domain configurations and identify users located in secondary geo-regions.\n</li><li>Prepare to configure accepted domains with the new geo-region property.</li><li>Review the documentation for configuring the feature: <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/enterprise/microsoft-365-multi-geo?view=o365-worldwide\" target=\"_blank\">Microsoft 365 Multi-Geo | Learn</a>&nbsp;</li></ul><p>We value your feedback and want to hear from you if you have any questions or concerns. Please comment or contact us through the M365 Admin Center if you need any assistance.</p><p><b>Compliance considerations:</b></p><ul><li>Does the change alter how existing user data is processed, stored, or accessed? - Yes. Emails are stored in-region based on domain configuration.</li><li>Does the change modify, interrupt, or disable any Purview capabilities? - Maybe. Depends on how DLP or retention policies are scoped by region.</li><li>Does the change alter how admins can monitor, report on, or demonstrate compliance activities? - Maybe. Regional routing may affect reporting granularity.</li></ul><p></p><p></p>",

It introduces new grounding sources (discussion posts), which may affect the relevance and scope of AI-generated answers.</li><li>Does the change provide users any new way of interacting with generative AI? - Yes.

At the tenant level, the corresponding settings <i>Configure workspace level inbound network rules</i> and <i>Configure workspace level outbound network rules</i> will be in the Advanced networking section of the Fabric admin portal.The new tenant-level settings will be disabled by default. You (the tenant admin) can switch ON the tenant toggle in the Fabric admin center if you decide to make this feature available to your workspace admins.

During Preview, admins can block inbound public access with the public REST API, which does not require a workspace-level private link set up in Azure.

When used with other networking features in Fabric, the <i>Outbound access protection</i> feature can help secure your data from exfiltration.  Workspace admins will be able to block all the outbound connectivity from the workspace. Once enabled, all outbound connections made by Fabric Spark artifacts from this workspace will be blocked. The only way to enable a connection is by first establishing a managed private endpoint (MPE) from the workspace to the destination.

Thank you for your patience.</p><p>Microsoft Purview Insider Risk Management (IRM) will be adding a new role--Data Security Investigation Contributor--to the Insider Risk Management Investigators role group. This will allow members of the Insider Risk Management Investigators role group to launch   a Data Security Investigation (DSI) from an IRM case. \n</p><p>DSI is a new AI-powered solution that enables data security teams to identify incident-related data, conduct deep content analysis, and mitigate risk within one unified solution. DSI enables data security admins to efficiently identify incident-relevant content by searching their Microsoft 365 data estate to locate emails, Teams messages, Copilot prompts and responses, and documents. Once the investigation is scoped, DSI’s generative AI capabilities allow admins to gain deeper insights into the impacted data, revealing critical security risks and sensitive information. Investigative capabilities include the ability to categorize evidence, perform vector searches, and examine impacted data for security and sensitive data risks. DSI visualizes correlations between investigation data, users, and their activities. To mitigate identified risks, DSI facilitates secure collaboration between partner teams. Post-investigation learnings can be used to refine existing policies to strengthen an organization's security practices.  \n</p><p>The integration between IRM and DSI allows an IRM investigator to identify when a risky user needs deeper investigation to launch a pre-scoped investigation directly from the user activity pane, allowing them to view content analysis related to that user and better assess post-incident data impact.  \n</p><p>This message is associated with roadmap ID  <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?rtc=1%26filters%3D&amp;searchterms=485707\" target=\"_blank\">485707</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>\n</p><p><b>When this will happen:</b>\n</p><p>Public Preview (Worldwide): We will begin rolling out early April 2025 and expect to complete by late April 2025.</p><p>General Availability (Worldwide): We will begin rolling out in mid-July 2025 (previously mid-June) and expect to complete by mid-August 2025 (previously mid-July).</p><p> \n</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b> \n</p><p>With this update, members of the Insider Risk Management Investigators role group will be able to create Data Security Investigations from an Insider Risk Management case.

Insider Risk Management enables customers to create policies based on their own internal policies, governance and organizational requirements.

This ensures enterprise data protection for files in your organization, regardless of which account grants Copilot access. The setting for web grounding in Copilot is also based on the identity used to access the file. If you disabled web grounding in Copilot, users will not be able to use web grounding even when using Copilot access from another account.

We will provide a subsequent update by the end of May 2025 (previously end of March) with an updated timeline for tenants that are opted out.</p><p>We're going to start gradually dropping messages that have multiple From addresses (also known as P2 From headers) without a Sender header from being processed via Exchange Online, please review the section \"When this will happen\" for rollout timeline information for your tenant.</p><p>If we see significant traffic exhibiting multiple From addresses (P2 From headers) without a Sender header in your tenant in the month of September, we will send you a Message Center Post by October 15th alerting you and providing some sample message IDs.</p><p>We are doing this to comply with <a href=\"https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5322#section-3.6.2\" target=\"_blank\">RFC 5322 (https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5322#section-3.6.2)</a>&nbsp;which mandates the Sender header to be present and contain a single address if the From header has more than one address.

There is no action taken from these policies to block content, as policies are meant to scope what content is collected and surfaces to administrators.</li><li>Using collection policies to scope signal collection will impact what is surfaced in several Purview solutions, including Insider Risk Management (IRM), Data Security Posture Management (DSPM), eDiscovery, Data Lifecycle Management (DLM), Activity Explorer, and more.

These updates may affect your organizations current configuration in the following ways: \n</p><ul><li>Activities to audit on your tenant will be scoped to the selected SITs and user activities \n</li><li>A new Location picker experience will be used to scope users and groups \n</li><li>To use collection policies for endpoints, the DLP <i>Always audit </i>setting will still need to be enabled. However, once created, collection policies for endpoint devices adjust from an open policy to an allowlisting policy that supports inclusion and/or exclusion of specific users, groups, and specified activities to reduce load and address customer requirements. \n</li></ul><p>This feature is available by default for admins to configure.</p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b>\n</p><p>There is no immediate impact of this feature release until you create an initial collection policy and <i>Always audit</i> is enabled in DLP (Windows endpoint devices only). To prepare for this upcoming enhancement to the Purview portal, we recommend you:</p><ul><li>Review Microsoft Learn docs on collection policies and required prerequisites: <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/purview/collection-policies-solution-overview\" target=\"_blank\">Collection Policies Solution Oerview (preview) | Microsoft Learn</a></li><li>Help inform other Purview admins whose signal collection would be scoped, including the solutions in this message. \n</li></ul><p>This rollout will happen automatically by the specified dates with no admin action required before the rollout.

      "Content": "<p>We’ve made several usability improvements to enhance live captions and live transcripts in Microsoft Teams — making meetings more intuitive, less distracting, and more privacy-conscious.\n</p><p>First, live captions will be scrollable, allowing users to review the meeting conversation without interrupting the live view. To help protect sensitive content and support compliance with data handling policies, copying text from live captions is now disabled by default. This ensures captions remain a real-time experience, reducing the risk of content being copied and shared out of context.\n</p><p>Second, the <i>Live transcript</i> panel will no longer open automatically for the user who starts recording, which also triggers transcription in the background. Before this rollout, this panel only auto-opens for the person who initiates recording or transcription — not for other participants — but this can be distracting and isn’t always relevant to the user's intent. After this rollout, the <i>Live transcript</i> panel will remain closed unless manually opened or the user explicitly starts transcription. This gives users more control over their meeting layout and helps avoid unnecessary screen changes during important discussions.\n</p><p>Third, when transcription is enabled, users who attempt to open the<i> Live transcript</i> panel will now see a banner suggesting they switch to live captions instead. This helps guide users to the most appropriate feature for following the conversation in real time, improving comprehension and reducing confusion.</p><p>\n</p><p>This message applies to Teams for Windows desktop, Teams for Mac desktop, and Teams for the web. </p><p>This message is associated with Microsoft 365 Roadmap ID <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?filters=&amp;searchterms=495454\" target=\"_blank\">495454</a>.</p><p><b>When this will happen:</b></p><p>Targeted Release: We will begin rolling out early July 2025 and expect to complete by mid-July 2025.</p><p>General Availability (Worldwide, GCC): We will begin rolling out mid-July 2025 and expect to complete by late July 2025.</p><p>General Availability (GCC High): We will begin rolling out late July 2025 and expect to complete by early August 2025.</p><p>General Availability (DoD): We will begin rolling out early August 2025 and expect to complete by mid-August 2025.</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b></p><p>These updates improve usability, privacy, and accessibility in Teams meetings.

Before this rollout, admin changes made in the Integrated apps section of the Microsoft 365 admin center would only affect these Teams apps in Outlook and the Microsoft 365 app. Similarly, changes made in the Teams admin center would exclusively affect Teams. Starting in June 2024, we will roll out Unified App Management to streamline the management of these apps across Teams, Outlook and the Microsoft 365 App, so they are consistently available across all supported clients.</p><p>This message is associated with Microsoft 365 Roadmap ID <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?filters=&amp;searchterms=393931\" target=\"_blank\">393931</a>.\n</p><p><b>When this will happen:</b>\n</p><p>This rollout will happen in two major phases. Unified App Management can apply only to tenants that have migrated to app centric management in Teams admin center, as communicated in MC688930 <i>(Updated) Teams admin center: App centric management and changes to app permission policies</i> (November 2023).\n</p><ul><li>Phase 1 | General Availability (Worldwide): We will begin rolling out late-January 2025 (previously mid-December 2024) is now on hold (previously late March 2025), with further guidance to be provided by late May 2025 (previously late April). This phase applies to tenants with no modified settings in either the Microsoft 365 admin center (Integrated apps) or the Teams admin center for organization-wide defaults, app deployment, app availability, or block/unblock. No merge rules apply to these tenants, but after this phase, any app management setting configured in either admin centers will apply to all relevant hosts. \n</li><li>Phase 2: We will update this post with a timeline and more details in May 2025 (previously April 2025).&nbsp; This phase is applicable to tenants with app settings that have differences between Microsoft 365 admin center (Integrated apps) and Teams admin center.</li></ul><p>\n</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b>\n</p><p>Before this rollout, managing Teams apps that work in Outlook and the Microsoft 365 app was fragmented between the <i>Integrated app</i>s page in the Microsoft 365 admin center for Outlook and the Microsoft 365 app, and the Teams admin center for Teams. This sometimes resulted in different settings for the same app in the two admin centers. With Unified App Management, we will be consolidating app catalog management into a single platform. You will be able to manage apps on the <i>Integrated apps</i> page in the Microsoft 365 admin center or in the Teams admin center, and any changes made in either admin center will synchronize.\n</p><p><i>What you can expect</i>\n</p><ol><li>App catalog enhancements: Apps will start showing hosts where they are available: Teams, Outlook, or the Microsoft 365 app. \n</li><li>Organization-wide settings: App availability default settings will now apply to apps used in Teams, Outlook, and Microsoft 365 app.\n</li><li>App installs: Apps deployed from the Integrated apps page in Microsoft 365 admin center will be preinstalled in all applicable hosts for the app. Unlike app preinstallation in the Teams App setup policy, new app installs will provide access to the preinstalled apps, similar to deploying the app for Outlook and the Microsoft 365 App. <b>For more details on app deployment, refer to MC795355&nbsp;<i>Microsoft Teams admin center: App centric management for app installation and changes to app setup policies</i> (May 2024)</b>.</li><li>App availability: Managing app availability will apply to all applicable app hosts. \n</li><li>App block/unblock: Blocking or unblocking apps will apply to all applicable app hosts. \n</li><li>Consolidation of existing app settings: All existing app settings will be unified between Integrated apps (MAC) and Manage apps (TAC) pages. Merge rules can be found in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/MicrosoftTeams/manage-apps-across-m365\" target=\"_blank\">Manage apps that work across Teams, Outlook, and Microsoft 365 | Microsoft Learn</a>. These changes cannot be rolled back.\n</li><li>Consolidation report: After further review we have decided not to proceed with this change at this time. We apologize for any inconvenience.</li></ol><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b>\n</p><p>We recommend that you review app and tenant settings in the Microsoft 365 admin center and the Teams admin center.

      "Content": "<p>Updated June 26, 2025: We have updated the timeline below. Thank you for your patience.\n</p><p>This message replaces MC1024398<i> (Updated) Microsoft 365 apps: We will prompt users to back up their files in Microsoft OneDrive</i> (published March 2025, updated March 2025) and includes additional details. Please refer to this new post going forward:</p><p>Coming soon: Eligible users will be prompted in the Message Bar below the toolbar in Microsoft Word, Microsoft Excel, and Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows desktops to enroll in <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/sharepoint/redirect-known-folders\" target=\"_blank\">OneDrive Known Folder Move (KFM).</a> Users will be able to select the folders to back up in Microsoft OneDrive.\n</p><p><b>When this will happen:</b></p><p>Public Preview: We will begin rolling out mid-April 2025 and expect to complete by late April 2025. \n</p><p>General Availability (Worldwide): We will begin rolling out mid-May 2025 (previously early May) and expect to complete by late July 2025 (previously mid-June).</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b>\n</p><p>If your organization still has users who are not enrolled in KFM, the message \"BACK UP THIS DOCUMENT: Share and work with others in this and other files using OneDrive\" will encourage them to do it while using familiar desktop apps. After users select the Open OneDrive button, they can select the folders they want to back up in OneDrive:\n</p><p><img src=\"https://cxcs.microsoft.net/file/ccp/en-us/ca81daa5-b315-416d-966e-bed4ff8723ea\" style=\"width: 400px;\" alt=\"user message\">\n</p><p>When users are enrolled in KFM, the files in their enrolled folder benefit from the advantages of cloud files:\n</p><ul><li>Increased security and compliance: Enterprises can increase security and compliance, because all cloud files are subject to default classification, labeling, and protection (CLP) policies and auto-labeling. \n</li><li>Copilot support: Files are Copilot-enabled, making it simple and intuitive to access and leverage Copilot. (A Microsoft 365 Copilot license or a Microsoft 365 license is required to use Copilot.)</li><li>Easy collaboration: Cloud files enable sharing, commenting, and easy collaboration, with AutoSave ensuring changes are frequently and consistently saved. \n</li><li>Access from anywhere: Cloud files can be accessed from Windows, Mac, the web, iOS, and Android with synchronized changes. \n</li><li>Backup: Protection from data loss due to device failure. \n</li><li>Access to cloud-specific features like AutoSave and Version History</li></ul><p>After enrolling, users can access their files in the known folders in File Explorer or OneDrive. \n</p><p>No action required. The feature will be enabled automatically for eligible users. If KFM is blocked in your organization, the message will not be displayed. \n</p><p>If an organization has blocked KFM, we will honor that and not display the message to the organization's users.\n</p><p>This Message Bar will not appear if:\n</p><ul><li>The user is already enrolled in KFM\n</li><li>The user doesn’t have OneDrive provisioned, installed, and running\n</li><li>The existing policy to block KFM Wizard (<a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/sharepoint/use-group-policy#prevent-users-from-moving-their-windows-known-folders-to-onedrive\" target=\"_blank\">Prevent users from moving their Windows known folders to OneDrive</a>) is enabled and deployed\n</li><li>The new policy <i>Restrict KFM from Office</i> is enabled and deployed\n</li></ul><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b></p><p>This rollout will happen automatically by the specified date with no admin action required before the rollout. Review your current configuration and notify users about the change, explaining the benefits of OneDrive and the sync process. Consider updating any relevant documentation.\n</p><p>Based on your feedback, we created a new policy called <i>Restrict KFM from Office. </i>When this new policy is enabled and deployed, Office apps won’t show the Message Bar regardless of user eligibility. This policy is scoped only to Office apps and does not affect other OneDrive or KFM settings. This policy is available now in the <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=49030\" target=\"_blank\">Administrative Template files for Microsoft Office</a> (version 5497.1000 or newer).\n</p><p>If you don’t want the message prompting users to back up their files to display to users in your organization, you can enable and deploy the <i>Restrict KFM from Office</i> policy.</p><p>How to deploy this policy:\n</p><p>If you use  Active Directory, Microsoft Entra or hybrid environments,  you can use <b>Group Policy Objects</b>. Group policy can represent policy settings in the file system or in Active Directory Domain Services. When used with Active Directory, Group Policy settings are contained in a Group Policy Object (GPO).

Thank you for your patience.</p><p style=\"margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:7.5pt;margin-left:0in\"><b>Important update regarding the cloud hosted Mailbox External Recipient Rate Limit:</b>  In order to reduce the impact on customers, Microsoft has again decided to delay the rollout of the cloud hosted Mailbox External Recipient Rate Limit (MERRL) by ~six months. The MERRL will go into enforcement in April 2026 for trial tenants and new tenants if the tenant is provisioned on/after April 1st, 2026. In April 2026, the Exchange Admin Center Report will be available for tenant admins to review Sender mailbox data on external recipient volume. In October 2026, the MERRL will go into enforcement for all cloud hosted mailboxes in the WWMT environment including existing tenants.</p><p style=\"margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:7.5pt;margin-left:0in\">Please refer to the ACS email documentation (Prepare an email communication resource for Azure Communication Services - An Azure Communication Services concept article | Microsoft Learn) or reach out to your Microsoft account team for further support in this journey.</p><p style=\"margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:7.5pt;margin-left:0in\"><b>Please note:</b> We have made the decision to not proceed with this change for DoD, GCC, or GCC High organizations at this time. We will communicate via Message center when we are ready to proceed. The External Recipient Rate Limit will only apply to WWMT/Production.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:7.5pt;margin-left:0in\">Please refer to the ACS email documentation (Prepare an email communication resource for Azure Communication Services - An Azure Communication Services concept article | Microsoft Learn) or reach out to your Microsoft account team for further support in this journey.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:7.5pt;margin-left:0in\"> ________________________________________\n</p><p style=\"margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:7.5pt;margin-left:0in\"><br></p><p style=\"margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:7.5pt;margin-left:0in\">Today, we are announcing that, beginning in April 2026 (previously October 2025), Exchange Online will begin enforcing an external recipient rate limit of 2000 recipients in 24 hours.</p><p>Exchange Online does not support bulk or high-volume transactional email. We have not enforced limiting of bulk email until now, but we plan on doing so with the introduction of an External Recipient Rate (ERR) limit. The ERR limit is being introduced to help reduce unfair usage and abuse of Exchange Online resources. </p><p><b>When this will happen:</b></p><p>The new ERR limit will be introduced in 2 phases:</p><p>Phase 1 - Starting April 1, 2026, (previously October 2025) the limit will apply to cloud-hosted mailboxes of trial tenants and all tenants created after this date.&nbsp;</p><p>Phase 2 – Starting October 1, 2026, (previously April 2026) we will start applying the limit to cloud-hosted mailboxes of existing tenants.&nbsp;</p><p> <b>How this will affect your organization:</b></p><p>Exchange Online enforces a Recipient Rate limit of 10000 recipients for cloud-hosted mailboxes. The 2000 ERR limit will become a sublimit within this 10000 Recipient Rate limit. There is no change to the Recipient Rate limit, and both of these will be rolling limits for 24-hour windows. You can send to up to 2,000 external recipients in a 24-hour period, and if you max out the external recipient rate limit then you will still be able to send to up to 8,000 internal recipients in that same period. If you don't send to any external recipients in a 24-hour period, you can send to up to 10,000 internal recipients.</p><p>For example:\n</p><ul><li>You use a cloud-hosted mailbox to send to 1,000 external recipients and 2,000 internal recipients at 6:00AM on Day 1, for a total of 3,000 recipients. You then send to another 1,000 external recipients at 8:00AM on Day 1. Because you sent to 2,000 external recipients, you will be blocked from sending to external recipients until 6:00AM on Day 2. During this period, you are able to send to up to 6,000 internal recipients, but for this example, let's assume that you don't.\n</li><li>At 6:00AM on Day 2, the 1,000 external recipients and 2,000 internal recipients sent at 6:00AM on Day 1 will no longer count toward the 24-hour limit calculation. Thus, from 6:00-8:00AM on Day 2, you can send to up to 9,000 total recipients (e.g., 9,000 internal or 8,000 internal plus 1,000 external).\n</li><li>If you don't send to any internal or external recipients during this period, then at 8:00AM on Day 2 you can again send to 10,000 recipients total with up to 2,000 of them being external recipients.</li></ul><p>\n</p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b><br></p><p>If you have a cloud-hosted mailbox that needs to exceed the ERR limit, you can move to <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/communication-services/concepts/email/email-overview\" target=\"_blank\">Azure Communication Services for Email</a>, which is designed specifically for high volume email sent to recipients external to your tenant.</p>",

First, admins can set a default value for new apps that are published to the Teams app store. Second, admins can manage apps for users, groups, or everyone in the organization.

If a user’s policies conflict by allowing and blocking the same app for them, we will auto-migrate their app as allowed. After auto-migration, there will be a security group created for each set of users assigned to each app permission policy.

Thank you for your patience.\n</p><p>Coming soon for Microsoft Teams: App centric management for admin app installation introduces new admin settings to control who in the tenant has specific Teams apps preinstalled. Similar to app centric management for app availability, as communicated in MC688930 <i>(Updated) Teams admin center: App centric management and changes to app permission policies</i> (November 2023), admins will be able to install apps for users, groups, or everyone in the organization.</p><p>After rollout, app centric management will replace<i> Installed apps</i> in the Teams admin center and give admins the ability to install apps individually. The <i>Installed apps</i> in your app setup policies will be migrated to app centric management based on your current user and group assignments for each policy. The rest of your settings in app setup policies will remain unchanged and will continue to work based on app setup policies, including <i>Pinned apps</i>.

After rollout, these tenants will have app centric management enabled for their app installs. Admins may see the <i>Manage apps</i> page in read-only mode for a short time.\n</li><li>Phase 2 | More details coming soon as a follow up MC post. This phase applies to all remaining tenants.

It is an advanced method of sending messages to your users and requires proper configuration of SPF, DKIM, and DMARC to ensure messages are delivered successfully.</p><p>Many customers do not need to use Direct Send. Because SPF protections do not always outright block messages and sometimes deliver them to the Junk folder, it is possible for malicious senders mimicking Direct Send to have their messages that spoof your own domains land in the Junk folder and potentially confuse your users. Before this rollout, no feature existed to block Direct Send traffic for customers who have no need to use it. We will roll out the new <i>Reject Direct Send</i> setting for Exchange Online.</p><p><b>When this will happen:</b>\n</p><p>Public Preview: Available now.</p><p>General Availability (Worldwide, GCC, GCC High): We will begin rolling out early September 2025 and expect to complete by early September 2025.</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b></p><p>Direct Send covers anonymous messages sent from your own domain to your organization’s mailboxes and so enabling this setting will block any of that traffic. Direct Send traffic may include third-party services that you have given permission to use your domain or one of your own email applications hosted on-premises. To avoid having these messages rejected when this feature is enabled, they need to be authenticated. You can authenticate them by creating a <i>partner mail flow connector</i> for these messages.    \n</p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b>\n</p><p>This rollout has happened automatically by the specified dates with no admin action required before the rollout. Review your current configuration to assess the impact on your organization. You may want to notify your users about this change and update your relevant documentation.\n</p><p>By default, the new opt-in <code>RejectDirectSend</code> setting is set to <code>False</code>.  To enable the Reject Direct Send feature, Exchange Online admins can run this Microsoft PowerShell cmdlet: \n</p><p><code>Set-OrganizationConfig -RejectDirectSend $true</code>\n</p><p>The change should propagate out to your entire service within 30 minutes. With the feature enabled, any received Direct Send messages will see the following message:  \n</p><p><code>550 5.7.68 TenantInboundAttribution; Direct Send not allowed for this organization from unauthorized sources</code> \n</p><p>Unless you re-enable Direct Send, any messages that hit this error will need a partner connector created to authenticate their source as an approved sender.  \n</p><p>Learn more: <a href=\"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/exchange/introducing-more-control-over-direct-send-in-exchange-online/4408790\" target=\"_blank\">Introducing more control over Direct Send in Exchange Online | Microsoft Community Hub</a></p><p>We invite Exchange admins to try out the feature and provide feedback that we can use to validate and proceed to offering this feature for General Availability.</p>",

Expect no further delays beyond this date. Please review the information below for more details.\n</p><p>Updated October 18, 2024: We have updated the SMTP AUTH Clients Submission Report in the Exchange admin center, adding the Authentication Protocol column to show if Basic auth or OAuth is being used to submit email to Exchange Online. The data will build up over the next 90 days. Thank you for your patience.\n</p><p>Today, we are announcing that Exchange Online will permanently remove support for Basic authentication with Client Submission (SMTP AUTH) gradually beginning with a small percentage of submission rejections for all tenants on March 1st 2026 and reaching 100% rejections on April 30th 2026, (previously September 2025). After this time, applications and devices will no longer be able to use Basic auth as an authentication method and must use OAuth when using SMTP AUTH to send email.\n</p><p>Basic auth is a legacy authentication method that sends usernames and passwords in plain text over the network. This makes it vulnerable to credential theft, phishing, and brute force attacks. To improve the protection of our customers and their data, we are retiring Basic auth from Client Submission (SMTP AUTH) and encouraging customers to use modern authentication methods that are more secure.\n</p><p><b>When this will happen:</b>\n</p><p>We will be making this change beginning March 1st, 2026, and completing April 30th, 2026 (previously September 2025).\n</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b>\n</p><p>The SMTP AUTH Clients Submission Report in the Exchange admin center has been updated to show if Basic auth or OAuth is being used to submit email to Exchange Online. Starting in July 2025, we will send monthly Message Center posts to tenants who are using Basic auth with Client Submission (SMTP AUTH) to alert them to the upcoming change.\n</p><p>Starting March 1st 2026 (previously September 2025) we will gradually start rejecting Basic Auth requests to the Client Submission (SMTP AUTH) endpoints, increasing to 100% rejection by the end of the April 2026. \n</p><p>The Client Submission (SMTP AUTH) endpoints in scope for this change are:\n</p><p>•\tsmtp.office365.com\n</p><p>•\tsmtp-legacy.office365.com\n</p><p>Once Basic auth is permanently disabled, any clients or apps connecting using Basic auth with Client Submission (SMTP AUTH) will receive this response:\n</p><p>•\t550 5.7.30 Basic authentication is not supported for Client Submission.\n</p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b>\n</p><p>If your client supports OAuth, follow these steps: <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/exchange/client-developer/legacy-protocols/how-to-authenticate-an-imap-pop-smtp-application-by-using-oauth\" target=\"_blank\">Authenticate an IMAP, POP or SMTP connection using OAuth</a>\n</p><p>If your client doesn’t support OAuth and you must use Basic Auth with Client Submission (SMTP AUTH), you will need to switch to one of the following alternatives before April 2026, previously September 2025:\n</p><p>•\tIf you are using basic authentication with Client Submission (SMTP AUTH) to send emails to recipients internal to your tenant, you can use Microsoft 365 High Volume Email. Please visit this site to learn more: <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/Exchange/mail-flow-best-practices/high-volume-mails-m365\" target=\"_blank\">Manage high volume emails for Microsoft 365 Public preview</a>\n</p><p>•\tIf you are using basic authentication with Client Submission (SMTP AUTH) to send emails to recipients internal and external to your tenant, you can use Azure Communication Services Email.

DSI enables data security admins to efficiently identify incident-relevant content by searching their Microsoft 365 data estate to locate emails, Teams messages, Copilot prompts and responses, and documents. Once the investigation is scoped, DSI’s generative AI capabilities allow admins to gain deeper insights into the impacted data, revealing critical security risks and sensitive information. Investigative capabilities include the ability to categorize evidence, perform vector searches, and examine impacted data for security and sensitive data risks.

      "Content": "<p>Updated June 6, 2025: Enforcement actions on unlicensed OneDrive accounts are ongoing. Please continue to monitor your <a href=\"http://spo.ms/admin#/oneDriveAccounts/management\" target=\"_blank\">Unlicensed OneDrive Account report</a>, as all accounts listed will be subject to enforcement if no action is taken.  To support more informed decision-making, we’ve introduced new and more granular reasons for why an account may appear unlicensed but and has not been deleted. This added detail should help you take the appropriate actions for each case and will be available in your Unlicensed OneDrive Accounts report no later than June 24th.  In some cases, admin action is required to delete the accounts. The timeline for enforcement remains unchanged from our last update.</p><p>Enforcement began on January 27, 2025. The rollout has slowed to ensure a safe roll-out with sufficient time for admins to adjust. Admins should anticipate that it takes time for all unlicensed accounts to complete the enforcement process. The initial enforcement rollout will be complete by October 29, 2025.</p><p><b>Timeline for accounts unlicensed before July 28, 2025\n</b></p><ul><li>September 26, 2025: By this date, all unlicensed accounts transition to read-only mode. Admins are advised to check after this date. Checking earlier can result in an incomplete status snapshot.\n</li><li>October 29, 2025: By this date, all unlicensed accounts are archived. Admins are advised to check after this date. Checking earlier can result in an incomplete status snapshot.</li></ul><p><b>Timeline for accounts unlicensed after July 28, 2025</b></p><ul><li>For accounts unlicensed after July 28, 2025, the account will be put into read-only mode on the 60th unlicensed day, and will be archived or moved to the recycle bin on the 93rd unlicensed day.\n</li></ul><p><b>Example:\n</b></p><ul><li>Unlicensed Date: October 1, 2025\n</li><li>Day 60: Nov 30, 2025. The account is placed in read-only mode. </li><li>Day 93: January 2, 2026: The account is archived. If the user is still active in Entra ID but the admin hasn't enabled billing, then this is also the date on which the account will begin the deprovisioning process.</li><li>Admins are encouraged to monitor account statuses based on these timelines to ensure compliance and take any necessary actions.</li></ul><p><b>When will this happen:</b> \n</p><p>&nbsp;General Availability (Worldwide): We began rolling out late January 2025 and expect to complete by late October 2025 (previously late March).</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization</b>\n</p><p>After this storage policy goes into effect in your tenant, any OneDrive user accounts that have been unlicensed for more than 93 days will be archived automatically and will become inaccessible to end users. Admins can view these accounts with admin tools, but the accounts will not be accessible to users until admins take action on them. For example, a OneDrive account that became unlicensed on August 1, 2025 will be inaccessible to users as of October 1, 2025.</p><p>As an admin, you can view a list of unlicensed accounts in your tenant by navigating to SharePoint admin center &gt; <i>Reports &gt; OneDrive accounts</i>. Some admins will have access to this page as soon as July 26, 2024, but most admins will be able to access the page closer to August 16, 2024.\n</p><ul><li>Set up the Archive billing for unlicensed accounts to be able to access and edit the archived files.\n</li><li>Delete the unlicensed OneDrive account, if it does not have a retention policy applied to it. \n</li><li>Renew the unlicensed account to maintain access.\n</li></ul><p></p><p>The <i>Unlicensed OneDrive accounts</i> page that will be in Microsoft admin center:\n</p><p><img src=\"https://cxcs.microsoft.net/file/messagecenter/en-us/8f5c65a0-5515-49e1-b876-07e81c69a89a\" style=\"width: 400px;\" alt=\"admin controls\"> \n</p><p>After the unlicensed accounts are automatically archived, you can access the files in these accounts by enabling unlicensed account billing in the Microsoft 365 admin center. Once enabled, unlicensed account billing applies to all unlicensed OneDrive accounts in your tenant. There is a fee of $0.05/GB/month to store unlicensed accounts in the Microsoft 365 Archive, and a fee of $0.60/GB to reactivate accounts stored in the Microsoft 365 Archive. Account reactivation takes up to 24 hours and provides 30 days of access to the account, and then the account returns to an archived state.\n</p><p>If you take no action for OneDrive accounts that have been unlicensed for longer than 93 days, these accounts will remain inaccessible to end users until you set up an Azure subscription and enable unlicensed account billing in the Microsoft SharePoint admin center. This action will not affect tenants who have not changed the default tenant retention settings.\n</p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare</b>\n</p><p>To prepare for this change, admins can view a list of all the unlicensed OneDrive accounts in their tenant by going to the SharePoint admin center and navigating to <i>Reports &gt; OneDrive accounts</i> (this page will be rolled out to admins between July 26, 2024 and August 16, 2024). This page will provide the number of unlicensed accounts and why the accounts are unlicensed. You may have unlicensed accounts in your tenant for four reasons: \n</p><ol><li>Retention period – Account is no longer licensed but is still active because a retention period setting is keeping the account from being deleted.\n</li><li>Retention policy – Account is no longer licensed but is still active because a retention policy in Purview is keeping the account from being deleted. \n</li><li>Active user with no license – Account is active but is not licensed. This can happen if the license is removed but the user is not removed from Microsoft Entra ID (formerly Azure Active Directory).  \n</li><li>Duplicate accounts – Account is a duplicate because a licensed user has multiple OneDrive accounts associated with them. Duplicate accounts (also known as non-primary accounts) may arise if a user has geographic move, if a user leaves and then rejoins an organization, or from other factors. \n</li></ol><p>After you have taken inventory of your unlicensed accounts, we recommend that you take the following action before January 27, 2025. \n</p><ol><li>Delete unlicensed accounts that you no longer wish to retain. \n</li><li>Set up billing for accounts that you wish to retain.\n</li><li>You may want to notify your users about this change and update any relevant documentation.\n</li></ol><p>*<b>At this time, these changes do not apply to customers in Education tenants. An Education tenant is any tenant with more than 50% education licenses. Any tenant with fewer than 50% education licenses is considered commercial.&nbsp;</b>However, for any education tenant, unlicensed OneDrive accounts consume pooled storage and can pose security and compliance risks. IT admins can view the unlicensed accounts on the <i>OneDrive accounts</i> page to identify unlicensed accounts and take action.</p><p><i>Learn more</i>\n</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/SharePoint/unlicensed-onedrive-accounts\" target=\"_blank\">Manage unlicensed OneDrive user accounts - SharePoint in Microsoft 365 | Microsoft Learn</a>\n</li><li><a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/sharepoint/retention-and-deletion\" target=\"_blank\">OneDrive retention and deletion - SharePoint in Microsoft 365 | Microsoft Learn</a>\n</li><li><a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/admin/add-users/delete-a-user?view=o365-worldwide\" target=\"_blank\">Delete a user from your organization - Microsoft 365 admin | Microsoft Learn</a></li></ul><p></p>",

      "Content": "<p>As hybrid and remote collaboration continues to evolve, we’re seeing growing disparities in how people are seen, heard, and engaged during meetings. These challenges are particularly noticeable for participants joining remotely, using assistive technologies, or communicating through different modalities.</p><p>Before this rollout, sign language users face several challenges during meetings, including difficulty locating and identifying their interpreters, as well as ensuring proper positioning of interpreter video feeds. Furthermore, active speaker detection prioritizes audio, resulting in participants who communicate through sign language often receiving less visual prominence than verbal speakers. These challenges make it more difficult for Deaf and hard-of-hearing participants to remain fully engaged during meetings.\n</p><p>In Microsoft Teams, we are committed to addressing these gaps, with a particular focus on enhancing the meeting experience for Deaf and hard-of-hearing participants who communicate using sign language. As part of our initial efforts, we are introducing Sign Language Mode. When enabled, Sign language users will benefit from an enhanced meeting experience. Interpreters will be clearly identified in the participant roster and visually distinguished throughout meetings. Deaf and hard-of-hearing participants who use sign language will be automatically detected and elevated to active speaker status, ensuring equal prominence with spoken audio participants. This will help create a more equitable and collaborative environment for everyone.\n</p><p><b>NOTE:</b> Teams for Windows desktop and Teams for Mac desktop are required for sign language detection. Support for Teams for web will come later this year. Sign language detection will not work on mobile devices.

Thank you for your patience.\n</p><p>We will retire the <i>Monitor </i>action in the <i>Safe attachments</i> policy in Microsoft Exchange Online Protection (Microsoft Defender for Office 365) starting early July 2025 (previously late March) and ending by late August 2025 (previously late May).</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b>\n</p><p>A <i>Safe attachments</i> policy provides an additional layer of protection against malicious content (attachments) in emails by analyzing attachment content and behavior in a sandbox environment. This policy provides four actions: <i>Off, Monitor, Block, </i>and <i>Dynamic delivery.</i> We made the <i>Monitor </i>action available for customers who wanted a <i>Safe attachments</i> policy to process attachments, deliver the emails (without blocking malicious attachments), and track what happened with attachments identified as malicious.  Customers used <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-office-365/try-microsoft-defender-for-office-365?view=o365-worldwide#reports-for-your-evaluation-or-trial-of-defender-for-office-365\" target=\"_blank\">reports </a>to see detections from the <i>Monitor </i>action in the policy.\n</p><p>As part of this retirement, if your organization has <i>Safe attachments</i> policies set to the <i>Monitor </i>action, we will automatically change the action in from <i>Monitor </i>to <i>Block.</i> We will not change the policy's recipients, status, or priority. After retirement, the <i>Monitor </i>option will not be available in the Safe Attachments policy page in the Defender security portal or the corresponding Microsoft PowerShell cmdlet.\n</p><p>Before retirement, you can find the <i>Monitor </i>action in Defender &gt; <i>Email &amp; collaboration &gt; Policies &amp; rules &gt; Threat policies &gt; Safe attachments &gt;</i> choose a policy or create a new policy &gt;<i> Edit settings</i> (or <i>Settings </i>if creating a new policy).

Microsoft Teams Android devices will be migrating to this platform. The first step in the migration is a firmware update to Microsoft Teams Android devices in 2024. The firmware update will move devices from Android device administrator to Android AOSP management.</p><p><b>When this will happen:</b></p><p>A Preview program for select Microsoft Teams Android devices is targeted for Q2 of calendar year 2024. General release of the firmware update with the Android AOSP management stack will happen starting in Q4 of calendar year 2024 throughout Q1 of calendar year 2025 for all eligible Microsoft Teams Android devices. Auto updates will commence starting May 15th into Q3 calendar year 2025.</p><p>Eligible Microsoft Teams Android devices will initially receive a manual firmware update in Teams Admin Center so IT admins can manually verify the migration on their own schedule on select devices of their choosing.</p><p>Eventually, the firmware update for migration will be scheduled as an automatic firmware update in Teams Admin Center. This automatic firmware update can be deferred for up to 60 days from first availability based upon the admin configured stages in Teams Admin Center.</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b></p><p>The firmware upgrade, including the support for Intune management of Android (AOSP) devices must be accepted. It can be deferred for up to 60 days after it is first available.

Thank you for your patience.</p><p>Non-Native and Hybrid Microsoft Viva Engage (formerly Yammer) Networks will be upgraded to Native Mode to allow users, groups, and content to be compatible with and mapped to their counterparts in Azure Active Directory and Microsoft 365. Native Mode also provides other benefits, such as the ability to host Live Events in every Viva Engage community and simplify file administration through SharePoint. Most critically, Native Mode supports eDiscovery through the Microsoft Purview compliance portal, allowing your organization to collaborate safely and securely within your Viva Engage network. 90% of Viva Engage networks are in Native Mode today, including our top 10 largest networks.<br></p><p><b>When this will happen:</b></p><p>We will begin migrating networks on December 01, 2022, and continue the upgrades through late December 2024 (previously January). The process will begin with smaller networks. If you prefer to control the timing of your upgrade, you may initiate the process on your own at any time by visiting the Microsoft 365 Native Mode page within the Network Admin pages of Viva Engage.\n</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b></p><p>You will lose access to the following features:\n</p><ul><li>Network-level guests \n</li><li>Email blocked lists\n</li><li>Secret groups\n</li></ul><p>If your organization has active guest users, <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/yammer/get-started-with-yammer/azure-ad-b2b-guests-yammer\" target=\"_blank\">Azure Active Directory B2B guest functionality</a> can be used for guests who reside in the same geography as the Viva Engage network (US guests for US networks; EU guests for EU networks). Guests will need to be reinvited to your network.\n</p><p>If your organization currently uses an email blocked list to manage access to your Viva Engage network, you can continue to manage access from the Azure Active Directory Portal. Learn more by visiting <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/viva/engage/manage-viva-engage-users/add-block-or-remove-users\" target=\"_blank\">Add, block, or remove a Viva Engage user</a> and <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/viva/engage/manage-engage-licenses-microsoft-365\" target=\"_blank\">Manage Viva Engage Core user licenses in Microsoft 365</a>.\n</p><p>These feature equivalents are only available to networks in Native Mode. There is no feature equivalent to secret groups in Microsoft 365; all groups must be public or private.\n</p><p>As part of the migration process, the Viva Engage administrator account will be added to all groups in the network, and files may be renamed.\n</p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b></p><p><i>If you would like to self-initiate your migration:\n</i></p><ul><li>There is a <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/yammer/configure-your-yammer-network/native-mode-step-by-step-guide\" target=\"_blank\">step-by-step guide to Native Mode migration</a> available. You can run an alignment report that will identify gaps in your current network alignment with Native Mode. It is critical that you back up your network’s data and communicate the migration to your users prior to running the Alignment Tool mentioned in the guide, as some data may be deleted during the process.\n</li></ul><p><i>If you would like Microsoft to initiate your migration:\n</i></p><ul><li>You are not required to take any action. You can run an alignment report that will identify gaps in your current network alignment with Native Mode.

Microsoft Copilot will also become available in the Store for users to add on their own, managed by the same admin settings used for app availability today.

Thank you for your patience.</p><p>The \"Manage what attendees see\" feature in Microsoft Teams helps organizers deliver polished events more easily by simplifying the attendee view and keeping the focus on participants who have been brought on screen. We’re introducing a new enhancement that gives organizers and presenters even more control over when shared content becomes visible to attendees.</p><p>Currently, when a presenter shares content, it is automatically displayed for attendees. With this update, shared content will first appear in the Manage screen’s left panel alongside other presenters. An organizer or presenter must manually bring it on screen, providing greater control over the attendee experience and preventing unintended interruptions.<br></p><p>Once shared content is brought on screen, the presenter sharing it will now see their content displayed instead of a text message indicating they are sharing.<br></p><p>Additionally, organizers and presenters joining from mobile will only see participants or content that has been brought on screen. Previously, users would see all organizers and presenters on their mobile devices.</p><p><img src=\"https://cxcs.microsoft.net/file/ccp/en-us/09ece2e5-3672-44e8-b0eb-0315d6e1108b\" style=\"width: 500px;\"><br></p><p>Limitations:</p><ul><li>Users joining through older Teams versions will continue to see the existing behavior, where shared content is automatically brought on screen.</li><li>PowerPoint Live will automatically be brought on screen and will not appear in the Manage screen panel.</li></ul><p>This message is associated with Microsoft 365 Roadmap ID <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?filters=&amp;searchterms=483486\" target=\"_blank\">483486</a>.</p><p><b>When this will happen:</b></p><p>Targeted Release: We will begin rolling out early April 2025 and expect to complete by mid-April 2025.</p><p>General Availability (Worldwide): We will begin rolling out early May 2025 and expect to complete by mid-May 2025.</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b>\n</p><p>Any new meetings or events created or updated after mid-April 2025 will receive the new improvements to the \"Manage what attendees see\" feature by default.</p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b>\n</p><p>This rollout will happen automatically by the specified dates with no admin action required before the rollout.

      "Content": "<p>Updated April 21, 2025: We have updated the timelines below. Thank you for your patience.</p><p>To reduce the risk of misuse and abuse of Exchange Online resources and ensure service availability for all users, we’ll soon introduce new tenant-level outbound email limits, known as the Tenant External Recipient Rate Limit or TERRL. The TERRL restricts the number of external recipients a tenant can send email to per day. If the limit is exceeded further messages sent to external recipients from the tenant will be blocked until the volume for the last 24 hours drops below the quota. A tenant’s TERRL quota is calculated based on the number of email licenses a tenant has purchased. Here is the formula used to calculate a tenant’s quota:\n</p><p>500 * (Purchased Email Licenses^0.7) + 9500\n</p><p>To help admins plan and track their outbound email volume, you’ll find a new report in the Exchange admin center: <i>EAC &gt; Reports &gt; Mail flow &gt; Tenant Outbound External Recipients Rate</i>. This report shows the current volume of external recipients, your tenant’s daily quota, how much of the quota is used, and the number of recipients that were blocked if the limit was exceeded. The report will also show if enforcement for the limit is enabled or disabled. For example, for tenants who have more than 500 email licenses it will show “Disabled” until May 1st, the day we’ll start to enable enforcement for tenants who have more than 500 licenses.\n</p><p><b>When this will happen:</b></p><p>This change will roll out in progressive stages over the month of March as per the following rollout schedule:</p><table class=\"table table-bordered\"><tbody><tr><td>Phase</td><td>Enable enforcement for tenant group</td><td>Rollout start date</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Tenants with &lt;= 25 email licenses</td><td>April 3, 2025</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>+ additional tenants with &lt;= 200 licenses</td><td>April 18, 2025</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>+ additional tenants with &lt;= 500 licenses</td><td>April 28, 2025</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>+ all remaining tenants</td><td>May 9, 2025</td></tr></tbody></table><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b></p><p>If your tenant exceeds its daily outbound sending limit further messages sent to external recipients will be blocked and senders will receive one of the following bounce messages (also known as Non-Delivery Receipts or NDRs):\n</p><ul><li>Trial tenants: 550 5.7.232 - Your message can't be sent because your trial tenant has exceeded its daily limit for sending email to external recipients (tenant external recipient rate limit)\n</li><li>Non-trial tenants: 550 5.7.233 - Your message can't be sent because your tenant exceeded its daily limit for sending email to external recipients (tenant external recipient rate limit)\n</li></ul><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b></p><p>Check the report in the EAC to see your tenant’s quota and current daily outbound email volume and whether or not any messages will be blocked once the TERRL is enabled for your tenant. If your current outbound email volume is well below the quota, you don’t have to do anything. If your outbound email volume is near or exceeding your quota, consider using <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/communication-services/overview\" target=\"_blank\">Azure Communication Services email</a> for high-volume email to external recipients instead. ACS email which offers significant advantages and features for high-volume email, especially for external recipients. Messages sent using ACS email are not counted against your Tenant External Recipient Rate Limit quota.\n</p><p>For more information about the Tenant External Recipient Rate feature and report please see this blog post:\n</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/exchange/introducing-exchange-online-tenant-outbound-email-limits/4372797\" target=\"_blank\">Introducing Exchange Online Tenant Outbound Email Limits</a></li></ul>",

We have made progress on closing several parity gaps with more changes in development to be released in the coming quarters. Please refer to <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/exchange/clients-and-mobile-in-exchange-online/deprecation-of-ews-exchange-online\" target=\"_blank\">Deprecation of Exchange Web Services in Exchange Online</a> for up-to-date guidance and roadmap information.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>If you haven't already, start the process of working with your application development organization and your application vendors to migrate active EWS applications on your tenant to the Graph API.&nbsp;</p><p>\n</p><p><b>When this will happen:</b></p><p>October 1, 2026</p><p><b>How this affects your organization:</b></p><p>While the EWS components of the service will continue to receive security updates and certain non-security updates, product design and features will remain unchanged. This change also applies to the EWS SDKs for Java and .NET, as well.\n</p><p>Despite this announcement, EWS is still available and supported for use in production environments. But we strongly suggest migrating to Microsoft Graph to access Exchange Online data and gain access to the latest features and functionality.\n</p><p>Today’s update and the retirement of EWS apply only to Microsoft 365 and Exchange Online (all environments); there are no changes to EWS in Exchange Server. Further, the changes in Exchange Online do not affect Outlook for Windows or Mac, Teams, or any other Microsoft product.</p><p>In our original blog post, we said this change would affect only third-party (non-Microsoft) applications.<b> We have expanded our effort and are now also removing EWS dependencies from Microsoft apps and services, and we’re going to complete that work well before October 2026</b>. We intend to do this as quickly as possible without affecting the quality of service or product.&nbsp;</p><p>There may be applications running on your tenant created by your organization or 3rd parties that use EWS. <b>We recommend <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/admin/activity-reports/ews-usage?view=o365-worldwide\" target=\"_blank\">reviewing your application portfolio</a> now </b>to get an understanding of which apps need to be updated by your organization and which applications require updates from vendors.</p><p>It is important to get started with this effort as soon as possible as the Graph API patterns are quite different from EWS. Equivalent Graph API operations may exhibit subtle differences that affect your use cases and application designs in unanticipated ways.</p><p>Migrating Applications to Microsoft Graph&nbsp;</p><p>We know there are several feature gaps between EWS and Microsoft Graph, and though the list below is not exhaustive, these are the gaps most frequently reported to us by developers:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Access to Archive Mailboxes – We are working on delivering access to archive mailboxes via Microsoft Graph and will provide an updated timeline in the coming months.\n</li><li>Folder Associated Information / User Configuration – We are working on these features and will provide an updated timeline in the coming months.\n</li><li>Exchange Online Management – We are investigating solutions for this and will provide an updated timeline in the coming months.</li><li>Access to Public Folders – After evaluating the usage of public folders, we have decided to restrict programmatic access to public folders to supported Outlook clients only, and for bulk import/export purposes. We will not provide APIs for programmatically creating, reading, updating and deleting public folders after October 2026 (also see <a href=\"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/exchange/security-related-updates-in-exchange-online/4303525\" target=\"_blank\">Security Related Updates in Exchange Online</a>).&nbsp;</li></ul><div><br></div><p>We know there are other gaps not listed above, and we continue to work on closing them, but it’s possible some functionality will not make it to Microsoft Graph. We encourage you to refer to <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/exchange/clients-and-mobile-in-exchange-online/deprecation-of-ews-exchange-online\" target=\"_blank\">Deprecation of Exchange Web Services in Exchange Online</a> for up-to-date guidance and roadmap information.&nbsp;</p><p><b>Next Steps\n</b></p><p>The retirement of these APIs follows our <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/lifecycle/policies/modern\" target=\"_blank\">Modern Lifecycle Policy</a>. We understand changes like this may cause some inconvenience, but we are confident it will ensure more secure, reliable, and performant experiences.\n</p><p>We will publish regular communications as we progress towards this deadline to aid affected tenants in identifying EWS usage. We encourage all customers to monitor Message Center and the Exchange Blog and <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/exchange/clients-and-mobile-in-exchange-online/deprecation-of-ews-exchange-online\" target=\"_blank\">Deprecation of Exchange Web Services in Exchange Online </a>for related content.&nbsp;</p><p>Thank you in advance for updating and opening your apps to a wider range of useful and intelligent features on Microsoft Graph. We are extremely excited about the growing opportunities that Microsoft Graph offers to developers, and we remain fully committed to our journey to empower developers to access Microsoft 365 data with the most modern features and tools.</p>",

Additionally, the sync experience on OneNote for Windows 10 may be slower compared to OneNote on Windows.\n</li><li><b>A Smooth Transition Experience</b>: Starting in July 2025, users of OneNote for Windows 10 will receive in-app banner notifications guiding them to switch to OneNote for Microsoft 365 ensuring a smooth transition and continuity in their workflow.</li></ul><p><b>What you can do to prepare:</b></p><p>To help your users transition smoothly, we recommend starting the migration process now.

      "Content": "<p>Coming soon: You will be able to extend Microsoft Purview to the network layer by integrating Purview with your preferred Secure Access Service Edge (SASE) / Security Service Edge (SSE) solution. Through this integration, admins can intercept and inspect traffic flowing through the network layer to identify the presence of sensitive data. This enables admins to detect sensitive data shared with untrusted cloud applications through browsers, applications, APIs, add-ins, and more, including common generative AI, cloud storage, and content sharing services. The signals from inline discovery for the network further enrich Purview solutions including Data Security Posture Management (DSPM) and Insider Risk Management (IRM), helping admins better understand how to reduce data exfiltration risks to locations outside of their organization.

These policies are designed to discover relevant signals from data in transit without executing any enforcement actions on that data.  \n</p><p>After integrating with one of our already-integrated Secure Access Service Edge (SASE) / Security Service Edge (SSE) partners, data security admins will be able to centrally create and manage policies for the network from the Purview portal. \n</p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b>\n</p><p> After rollout, the new policies and features will be available by default for you to enable and configure. These integrations require action by your Purview Data Security and Compliance admins to enable discovery in your organization before any signals will start to be collected, including configuring a SASE/SSE integration and creating a collection policy that targets unmanaged cloud apps. \n</p><p>Also, your global admin will need to activate Purview pay-as-you-go meters to enable this capability. We will update this message in May 2025 with pricing details.\n</p><p>This rollout will happen automatically by the specified dates with no admin action required before the rollout.

Between July 1st and August 1st, 2025, we will gradually switch provisioning of all A records for new Accepted Domains into the new subdomains under mx.microsoft.</p><p>We are doing this to reduce the friction of adopting DNSSEC in the long run. DNSSEC is a set of extensions to DNS that provides cryptographic verification of DNS records, preventing DNS spoofing and adversary-in-the-middle attacks to DNS.\n</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b>\n</p><p>After August 1st 2025, all A records for new Accepted Domains will be provisioned into the new subdomains under mx.microsoft.\n</p><p>DNS resolution will safely fallback to “plain” DNS if a domain is not DNSSEC enabled. If an Accepted Domain you add to the Exchange Admin Center after July 1st is not secured with DNSSEC at the domain level (ex. contoso.com), then DNS resolution will work as usual. If an Accepted Domain you add to the EAC after July 1st is secured with DNSSEC, then DNSSEC will extend to the mx.microsoft DNS record automatically and you will get the benefits of DNSSEC without having to take any further action. Any issues with DNSSEC can be addressed by disabling DNSSEC for the Accepted Domain (ex. contoso.com) via your DNS provider.\n</p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b>\n</p><p>If you have any automation in place, for example in workflows for Domain Setup, for MX record creation that expects A records for newly provisioned Accepted Domains to be provisioned in mail.protection.outlook.com, this automation needs to be updated by July 1st to use List serviceConfigurationRecords Graph API (<a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/graph/api/domain-list-serviceconfigurationrecords?view=graph-rest-1.0&amp;tabs=http\" target=\"_blank\">List serviceConfigurationRecords</a>). Use List serviceConfigurationRecords to retrieve the mailExchange value for your MX record. After July 1st, List serviceConfigurationRecords Graph API will be the only source of truth for your Accepted Domains’ MX record value. You will not be able to rely on the Accepted Domain’s A record being provisioned in mail.protection.outlook.com after July 1st.\n</p><p>If you are using automation that expects the record to end with mail.protection.outlook.com, when you add a new Accepted Domain to the Exchange Admin Center after July 1st, mail flow may not work upon initial configuration and you will have to update your MX record to match what the Exchange Admin Center says for the domain or use the mailExchange value returned by List serviceConfigurationRecords Graph API.\n</p><p>If you expect this change to cause any issues for your organization, please share that feedback. \n</p><p><br></p>",

Once set-up, because the deletion by a priority cleanup policy is irreversible and can override existing holds, the process requires multiple approvals, specific roles, and is audited.

The last day of its availability is on March 31, 2025. This change is being made as we streamline search experiences and focus on enhancing core productivity tools.\n</p><p>The Microsoft Edge for Business address bar and the Windows search box will continue to support work and school search, with some adjustments detailed below. \n</p><p>Details of the Change\n</p><p>After March 31, 2025, Microsoft Search in Bing will no longer be available, with changes as follows:\n</p><ul><li>Bing.com will no longer show work or school search results. Consequently, there will not be a dedicated page of work or school results and users’ work or school profiles will no longer appear on Bing.com. However, selecting the Work or School tab on Bing.com will redirect users to the new Microsoft Search experience on M365.cloud.microsoft (formerly Office.com and Microsoft365.com).\n</li><li>Search boxes you’ve configured to point to Microsoft Search in Bing will no longer provide work or school results.\n</li><li>The Edge for Business address bar and Windows search box will continue to support work and school search with some adjustments, including:\n<ul><li>The Edge for Business address bar will no longer return work or school search results on a Bing.com page but will continue to provide suggested results in the address bar. In addition, the address bar will send users to work and school results on M365.cloud.microsoft rather than Bing.com. Users of the address bar can continue to find work-related documents, bookmarks, and people in suggested results—clicking on these suggestions takes users to work or school results on M365.cloud.microsoft. Users can also type \"work\" in the address bar, hit the tab key, then input their work- or school-related query to get results on a M365.cloud.microsoft page. Work and school search results will include documents, people, and bookmarks. Work search for documents will be available initially, with additional content types available as quickly as possible.\n</li><li>The Windows search box will no longer display organization branding nor the “Work” or “School” tab but will continue to support work and school search. Search for documents and people remains available. will be available initially, with additional content types available as quickly as possible. With these changes, users will see some UX changes in the Windows search box.\n</li></ul></li></ul><p>As before, the core Microsoft Search experience remains accessible through M365.cloud.microsoft (formerly Office.com and Microsoft365.com) and SharePoint Online.\n</p><ul><li>Additionally, Entra ID sign-in will no longer be available on Bing.com, since work and school search is no longer available on Bing.com.\n</li></ul><p>An FAQ and further details are now available at <a href=\"https://aka.ms/MSBFAQ\" target=\"_blank\">Guidance for retiring Microsoft Search in Bing for your organization</a>, which will be updated regularly.\n</p><p><b>When will this happen:</b></p><p>The last day of availability of Microsoft Search in Bing is March 31, 2025.\n</p><p><b>How this affects your organization:</b></p><p>For organizations using Microsoft Search in Bing, users will need to transition to using Microsoft Search through M365.cloud.microsoft (formerly Office.com and Microsoft365.com) and SharePoint Online. \n</p><p>Users who are accustomed to using the Edge for Business address bar and the Windows search box can continue to conduct work searches through these endpoints entry points, with the expectation that there will be some adjustment in these experiences after the deprecation date. (For details on changes, please refer to the FAQ: https://aka.ms/MSBFAQ.)\n</p><p>Users who click on suggestions in the Edge for Business address bar or Windows search box may be redirected to Microsoft365.com before March 31, 2025. Also, as we begin testing the retirement experience, a small set of users may find before March 31 that Bing is intermittently unavailable as an entry point for work search. We recommend that you proactively inform your users of the change and direct them to M365.cloud.microsoft (formerly Office.com and Microsoft365.com) and SharePoint Online. Adding M365.cloud.microsoft to their favorites or to the favorites bar in Edge for Business may be a helpful alternative pathway. \n</p><p><b>What you can do to prepare:</b></p><p>Customers should prepare to stop using Microsoft Search in Bing by March 31, 2025, and transition to using Microsoft Search through M365.cloud.microsoft (formerly Office.com and Microsoft365.com) and SharePoint Online. We recommend that you inform users about the upcoming change and the alternatives available. \n</p><p>Adding your preferred entry point from this set to favorites or favorites bar in Edge may be a helpful alternative pathway. Admins can easily set favorites in Edge for their organization, please see details here. \n</p><p>Additionally, users can continue to use the Edge for Business address bar and the Windows search box, with some changes expected. Please educate users that they should now type \"work\" in the address bar, hit the tab key, then type in their work-related query to get work results on a M365.cloud.microsoft page.\n</p><p>If your organization is using the <code>AddressBarMicrosoftSearchInBingProviderEnabled</code> policy today, you should update to the <code>AddressBarWorkSearchResultsEnabled</code> policy, if the policy is still needed.   \n</p><p>The new policy, <code>AddressBarWorkSearchResultsEnabled</code>, will be available starting in early March, with Edge for Business version 134 (ahead of the Microsoft Search in Bing deprecation). This allows admins to configure the display of work suggestions in the address bar. If the policy is enabled or not configured, users who are signed into Edge for Business with their Entra ID can view internal work-related suggestions, such as bookmarks, files, and people results powered by Microsoft 365, in the Edge for Business address bar suggestion dropdown. If the policy is disabled, Entra ID signed-in users will not see internal workplace results in the Microsoft Edge address bar suggestion dropdown. \n</p><p>Admins who wish to set their own deprecation date prior to March 31, 2025, can turn off Microsoft Search in Bing by going to the Microsoft 365 admin center &gt; Settings &gt; Search &amp; Intelligence.\n</p><p>Regarding SafeSearch settings: \n</p><ul><li>If you had set the search experience for your organization to “School search,” SafeSearch was set to Strict by default. If you’d like to ensure that your users continue to have SafeSearch set to Strict after the Microsoft Search in Bing retirement, you can map www.bing.com to strict.bing.com at a network level.

Thank you for your patience.</p><p>Coming soon: A new license request feature and self-service purchase for Microsoft 365 Copilot will be widely available for all tenants. End user license request and self-service purchase will now be available for users with Microsoft 365 E1, Microsoft 365 E3, Microsoft 365 E5, Microsoft Office 365 Plan E1, Microsoft Office 365 Plan E3, Enterprise Mobility + Security E3, Enterprise Mobility + Security E5, Microsoft 365 Apps for Business and standalone products.  Both License request and self-service purchase will be shown within Microsoft 365 apps such as Copilot Chat, the unpaid version of work chat included in your Microsoft 365 subscription.  \n</p><p>\n</p><p>License Request allows users to request a Microsoft 365 Copilot license directly from their admin. This helps you efficiently assign unused licenses or purchase additional ones and assign based on user request. Global admins, license admins, and user admins will be able to manage these requests seamlessly in the Microsoft 365 admin center and can choose between standard or custom messaging, including directing to a third-party URL.</p><p>Self-Service Purchase allows users to purchase Microsoft 365 Copilot licenses directly with their own credit card and use within their tenant with their Microsoft admin’s visibility and control. <b>Note: </b>If your organization has previously disabled self-service purchase for Microsoft 365 Copilot, your existing settings will be honored.</p><p>This message is related to MC853238 (Updated) Microsoft 365 admin center: New self-service purchase and trial settings (published August 2024, updated September 2024).

Once this expiry period is over, in case someone clicks the link (e.g. outside of Teams app OR in the meeting details inside Teams calendar section), they will be unable to join the meeting.</p><p>Note: Old links created before short meeting URL release will continue working as it previously was (user will be able to join even after the documented expiry limits).</p><p>The reason why we are making this change is simple: security is our topmost priority. Maintaining a high security level is essential to protect sensitive data, prevent financial losses, ensure business continuity, and meet compliance and legal obligations. It is a critical aspect of modern digital life and business operations. This adjustment is designed to enhance the security of Teams meeting links, thereby better safeguarding the customer tenant. We want to be on par with modern security standards, that’s why the new behavior is a step in the right direction that we must take. It’s not possible to keep the current behavior. If you think it breaks some of your business processes, please leave comment to the MC post and describe your case there. \n</p><p>Recommendations in case the meeting link has expired:  \n</p><p>For meeting organizer: We recommend scheduling a new meeting. If the meeting organizer got removed from the tenant someone else should reschedule their meetings from scratch. \n</p><p>For participant: Please reach out to the meeting organizer and ask them to reschedule the meeting or send you an updated link.</p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b>\n</p><p>You may want to check if you have any integrations that use parameters from URL. After the rollout, the URL will only contain the meeting ID. Parameters such as tenant ID, organizer ID, conversation ID and message ID will not be in the URL. \n</p><p>You may inform meeting organizers from your tenant who use expired meeting links, or you may want to make a tenant-wide announcement about this change. \n</p><p>This rollout will happen automatically by the specified date with no admin action required.

The current behavior of the EWSEnabled flag is that it can be set at both the tenant (organization) level and the user (mailbox) level. Currently, when the flag is set to true at the user level, it takes precedence over the organization-level setting. If a setting is Null, it means the setting is not enforced at that level. If Org and user-level are both Null, the default behavior is to allow. This hierarchical structure means that if the organization-level flag is set to false, but the user-level flag is set to true, EWS requests from that user are still allowed. In summary:</p><table class=\"table table-bordered\"><tbody><tr><td>Organization Level</td><td>User Level&nbsp;</td><td>EWS Requests</td></tr><tr><td>True or &lt;null&gt;</td><td>True or &lt;null&gt;</td><td>Allowed</td></tr><tr><td>True or &lt;null&gt;</td><td>False</td><td>Not Allowed</td></tr><tr><td>False</td><td>True</td><td>Allowed</td></tr><tr><td>False</td><td>False or &lt;null&gt;</td><td>Not Allowed</td></tr></tbody></table><p>This approach has led to situations where it can be challenging for administrators to ensure uniform policy enforcement across their organization, particularly in large and complex environments.</p><p>New Behavior\n</p><p>To address these issues, we are altering the behavior so that EWS will only be allowed if both the organization-level and user-level EWSEnabled flags are true. Here's a simplified view of the new logic:</p><table class=\"table table-bordered\"><tbody><tr><td>Organization Level</td><td>&nbsp;User Level</td><td>EWS Requests</td></tr><tr><td>True or &lt;null&gt;</td><td>True or &lt;null&gt;</td><td>Allowed</td></tr><tr><td>True or &lt;null&gt;</td><td>False</td><td>Not Allowed</td></tr><tr><td>False</td><td>True or &lt;null&gt;</td><td>Not Allowed</td></tr><tr><td>False</td><td>False</td><td>Not Allowed</td></tr></tbody></table><p>In short, EWS will be permitted only if both the organization and user-level allow it. This change ensures that administrators have better control over EWS access and can enforce policies more consistently across their entire organization</p><p><b>Next Steps:</b>\n</p><p>Please check the blog for additional information and ensure your per-user and tenant wide settings are correct before this change is made to your tenant. \n</p><ul><li>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aka.ms/EWSEnabledChange\" target=\"_blank\">The way to control EWS usage in Exchange Online is changing</a>&nbsp;</li></ul><p><b><br></b></p>",

No admin action is required to initiate the change, and it is not possible to opt-out of this change.<br></li><li>Admins need to prepare for this change because the old URL may be saved in bookmarks, linked from intranet pages, or configured in network devices like proxies. We will indefinitely redirect URLs to the new domain ensuring uninterrupted access in many cases, but you must review any domain usage specific to your environment. It is not possible for us to identify all places within your environment where redirections may not function correctly. Users may initially need to refresh their browsers to receive the redirect if they are using Viva Engage once the change occurs.</li><li>Most attention is required to other usage of the old domain which may be hardcoded in a network proxy or security system. It is not possible for Microsoft to identify instances like these which exist inside your environment.

Check your configuration for desktop and mobile browsers because they may be different.</li></ul><p>Email Domain</p><ul><li><i>The sender domain used in emails from Viva Engage will start changing from @yammer.com to @engage.mail.microsoft.</i> This phased change to emails will continue until all Viva Engage email notifications and digests use the new sender domain. No admin action is required to initiate the change, and it is not possible to opt-out of this change.</li><li>Preparation for this change will depend on how you use the sender domain. If you have made specific customizations for the old domain in the past, then you may need to replicate the change for the new domain. If the old domain has been configured in transport rules, or an email gateway, then the new domain will need to be added. End users may need to update rules in Outlook. The impact will depend upon how you use the sender domain, so you will need to review your mail configuration and communicate with end users.</li><li>This change may go unnoticed by most users unless they have specific Outlook rules based on the sender domain.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://support.microsoft.com/office/manage-email-messages-by-using-rules-c24f5dea-9465-4df4-ad17-a50704d66c59\" target=\"_blank\">Outlook rules can be updated</a> to use the new domain without admin intervention, but you will need to communicate that the change is coming. <i>Moving to engage.mail.microsoft eliminates the need for yammer.com rules.

      "Content": "<p>As we continue to invest in a unified and modern Microsoft OneNote experience, we want to remind you that the OneNote for Windows 10 app will reach end of support on <b>October 14, 2025</b>. After this date, the app will no longer receive support, and the app will become read only.\n</p><p>To ensure the best experience moving forward, we strongly recommend switching your users to the <a href=\"https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/xpffzhvgqwwlhb?ocid=pdpshare&amp;hl=en-us&amp;gl=US\" target=\"_blank\">Microsoft OneNote for Windows</a> app as soon as possible. Our team is focusing on enhancing this app, providing a sleek and modern interface and improving security, and releasing new features like Loop components, voice dictation and transcription, ink improvements, a new meeting details experience, integration with the new Microsoft Outlook, and more to align with the evolving needs of our users.\n</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b>\n</p><p>Although OneNote for Windows 10 is supported until October 14, 2025, it is no longer receiving new feature updates, and it does not benefit from improvements to data syncing.\n</p><p>Starting in January 2025, users will start to see notifications in OneNote for Windows 10 about the end of support. These notifications will provide additional information and direct users to resources for a smooth transition.\n</p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b>\n</p><p><i>1. Migration guidance</i>:\n</p><p>We have developed a detailed <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoft-365-apps/deploy/deployment-guide-onenote\" target=\"_blank\">Deployment guide for OneNote</a> that includes best practices of migrating and a sample migration script. This sample script is designed to simplify the migration process for IT admins and to ensure that your users' unsynchronized data is backed up during migration. We believe this migration guidance will significantly help in achieving a successful migration process.\n</p><p><i>2. OneNote migration support in October 2024:</i>\n</p><p>To ensure a smooth transition, we are offering additional support from the OneNote team to help with the migration process for tenants who want to migrate early. The team is only available in the month of October 2024. After that, you will need to rely on the deployment guidance. To engage the OneNote team in October 2024, please provide feedback as usual on this post and include your email address.\n</p><p><i>3. App download restrictions for new users:</i></p><p>Starting November 1, 2024, new users will no longer be able to download OneNote for Windows 10 from the Microsoft Store. Given the app is approaching end of support and we are recommending using OneNote for Windows instead, we’re restricting new users from being able to install OneNote for Windows 10 moving forward. If you currently have the application installed, you will still be able to use it and receive updates until the end of support.\n</p><p>We are committed to supporting you through this transition and ensuring that your migration to OneNote for Windows is as seamless as possible.\n</p><p><i>Learn more\n</i></p><ul><li><a href=\"https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/XPFFZHVGQWWLHB?ocid=pdpshare\" target=\"_blank\">Download OneNote for Windows</a> from the Microsoft Store\n</li><li><a href=\"https://support.microsoft.com/office/what-is-happening-to-onenote-for-windows-10-2b453bfe-66bc-4ab2-9118-01e7eb54d2d6#:~:text=We%20recently%20announced%20the%20availability%20of%20the%20OneNote,Windows%2010%20will%20reach%20end-of-support%20in%20Oct%202025.\" target=\"_blank\">What is happening to OneNote for Windows 10 - Microsoft Support</a>\n</li><li><a href=\"https://support.microsoft.com/office/moving-to-onenote-on-windows-4ba7b498-aafc-44b1-8326-a582a6c71196\" target=\"_blank\">Moving to OneNote on Windows - Microsoft Support</a>\n</li><li><a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoft-365-apps/deploy/deployment-guide-onenote\" target=\"_blank\">Deployment guide for OneNote - Microsoft 365 Apps | Microsoft Learn</a></li></ul><p></p>",

Town hall will continue to serve as the platform where we will deliver new product value to our customers.</p><p>Teams Live Events will continue to be supported. We want to ensure that customers can upgrade to town hall on their own schedule as we work to bring new features and capabilities to town hall.

Customers will not be able to schedule, start, or join any events on Teams Live Events after this date. Existing recordings will be available to access until December 31, 2024. If customers want to retain any recordings from prior events, they will need to download the recordings and upload them to a different location before December 31, 2024. Between now and September 2024, customers can continue to use Teams Live Events with no change in their existing experience.
