      "Content": "<p>Updated November 20, 2025: We have updated the timeline. Thank you for your patience.</p><p><b>Introduction</b></p><p>We hear your feedback about ways we can improve the notifications experience in Viva Engage. It's always a fine balance between ensuring your users are notified of relevant content without notifications feeling too overwhelming or noisy. In response to your feedback, we're rolling out an intelligent notifications experience. Specifically, this change will improve how <i>Community Announcement</i> notifications are delivered. This smarter delivery approach optimizes notifications delivery based on a user’s engagement behavior, helping to reduce notifications fatigue while ensuring timely visibility of announcements.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><b>When this will happen</b><b></b></p><p><b>General Availability (Worldwide): </b>We will begin rolling out this change in mid-September 2025 and expect the rollout to continue in the coming few months. We will share an update on the final GA date once that becomes available.</p>\n\n<p><b>How this affects your organization</b>\n</p><p>Previously, when an admin created a new Community Announcement, this would send a notification in Teams and Mobile Push immediately, followed by an email notification two hours later if the announcement was not opened already in Teams and/or Mobile Push.&nbsp;\nWith this new update:\n</p><ul>\n<li>Users will now receive the notification in <b>one channel only</b>—either Teams, Mobile Push, or Email. This notification channel may differ by user and is selected based on where a user has opened Engage notifications most frequently in the past 30 days.&nbsp;</li><li>If the announcement is not opened within two hours in the first notification channel, a <b>secondary notification channel</b> will be sent, also determined by where a user opens Engage notifications most frequently.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>We will continue to respect all user notification preferences and settings where applicable. If a notification channel is disabled or the app is not installed, it will not be selected as a potential notification channel for the Community Announcement delivery.</p><p>Note that this change applies only to<b> regular Community Announcements in Viva Engage</b> and does not affect the \"immediate\" Community Announcement feature (where admins can still select the checkbox to send emails immediately —this functionality remains unchanged).</p><p><b>Can I still notify Community users via email immediately (along with other notification channels)?&nbsp;</b></p><p>Yes! In Viva Engage, we offer an option to send an “immediate” Community Announcement. With this feature, Community admins can choose to send email notifications immediately after posting a Community Announcement, even if a user has opted out of receiving emails. All other notification channels will also send immediately along with email, including Teams and Mobile Push. Therefore, we recommend admins to use this feature when there is a Community Announcement that requires immediate attention from users.&nbsp;</p><p>Community Admins can find this “immediate” Community Announcement option by firstly navigating to the announcement publisher and selecting the hyperlinked <b><i>“option to send emails immediately” </i></b>at the bottom of the publisher. Upon clicking this option, an additional pop-up box will open called <i><b>“Immediate email delivery”</b></i>. By selecting this checkbox, this will ensure that all three notification channels – Email, Teams, and Mobile Push – will send to customers immediately after a Community Announcement is made.&nbsp;</p><p><b>\n&nbsp;What you can do to prepare</b>\n</p><p>No admin action is required. However, we recommend:\n</p><ul>\n<li>Informing your users about the new notifications change to reduce confusion</li>\n<li>Monitoring user feedback and engagement with <i>Community Announcements' notifications delivery</i></li>\n<li>Reviewing internal communication strategies to align with the new notification's behavior</li></ul><p></p><p></p>\n<table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n<tbody><tr><th>Compliance Area</th><th>Explanation</th></tr>\n<tr><td>Does the change alter how existing customer data is processed, stored, or accessed?</td><td>Yes. Notification delivery logic now uses user behavior data (last 30 days of notification engagement) to determine delivery channels. This data is used to personalize delivery but is not stored permanently.</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Does the change introduce or significantly modify AI/ML or agent capabilities that interact with or provide access to customer data?</td><td>Yes. The system uses behavioral data to determine the most effective notification channel, which is a form of machine learning-based personalization.</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Does the change provide a new way of communicating between users, tenants, or subscriptions?</td><td>Yes. The change modifies how users receive communications (Community Announcements) by introducing a dynamic, behavior-based delivery method.</td></tr>\n</tbody></table>",

Thank you for your patience.&nbsp;</p><p><b>What it is</b></p><p>Microsoft is rolling out a new feature to streamline how app and agent availability is managed across Teams, Outlook, and Microsoft 365 Copilot. Until now, IT admins configured availability settings separately in both the Microsoft 365 Admin Center (MAC) and the Teams Admin Center (TAC), which led to mismatches. With this update, you’ll be able to unify availability policies for apps and agents across both portals, making app management more consistent and efficient<b>.</b></p><p>This message is associated with Microsoft 365 Roadmap ID <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?filters=&amp;searchterms=393931\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); font-family: sans-serif; font-weight: 400;\">393931</a>&nbsp;and <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?filters=&amp;searchterms=503105\" target=\"_blank\">503105</a>.</p><p><b>When this will happen:\n</b></p><p>We will begin rolling out this feature late September 2025 and expect to complete by end of June 2026 (previously mid-November 2025).</p><p>1. <b>Phase 1 – Default Tenant Unification</b></p><p>We will begin rolling out this feature at the end of September 2025. This initial phase targets tenants that have never modified their organization-wide defaults, app availability, or block/unblock in either the Microsoft 365 admin center or the Teams admin center.  At the end of this phase, agent and app manageability will be unified across both Microsoft 365 admin center and Teams admin center ensuring agent and Microsoft 365 <b>apps availability</b> policies are in alignment for all future administrative changes.

We will update this post with a timeline and more details later.</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization</b></p><p>Before this rollout, managing Teams apps that work in Outlook and the Microsoft 365 app was fragmented between the Integrated apps page in the Microsoft 365 admin center for Outlook and the Microsoft 365 app, and the Teams admin center for Teams. This sometimes resulted in different settings for the same app in the two admin centers. With Unified agent app management, you will be able to manage apps on the Integrated apps page in the Microsoft 365 admin center or in the Teams admin center, and any changes made in either admin center will synchronize.</p><div>What you can expect:\n</div><ul><li>You’ll gain a consolidated view of agent and Microsoft 365 app availability across both Microsoft 365 and Teams admin centers.\n</li><li>Changes made in either admin center to the agent and app availability will automatically apply across all supported hosts.\n</li><li>Organization-wide defaults for both admin centers will be in sync and govern app availability across Teams, Outlook, and the Microsoft 365 copilot app.</li></ul><p><b>&nbsp;What you need to do to prepare</b></p><p>To ensure a smooth transition, review your tenant-level and individual agent/app settings (app allow/block &amp; user availability) in both the Microsoft 365 Admin Center and the Teams Admin Center. If different departments within your organization manage these settings, we suggest coordinating efforts to complete the review collaboratively.\n</p><p>This update will be rolled out automatically by the stated date, and no immediate action is required. However, it's a good time to update any internal documentation related to agent and app management policies.&nbsp;</p><p>Learn more: <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/uam-tac-mac\" target=\"_blank\">Unified agent and app availability management across Microsoft 365 and Teams Admin Centers - Microsoft Teams | Microsoft Learn&nbsp;</a></p><p>\n</p>",

      "Content": "<p>Updated November 12, 2025: We have completed rollout of this feature. Thank you!<br><br>Coming soon: You will be able to extend Microsoft Purview to the network layer by integrating Purview with your preferred Secure Access Service Edge (SASE) / Security Service Edge (SSE) solution. Through this integration, admins can intercept and inspect traffic flowing through the network layer to identify the presence of sensitive data. This enables admins to detect sensitive data shared with untrusted cloud applications through browsers, applications, APIs, add-ins, and more, including common generative AI, cloud storage, and content sharing services. The signals from inline discovery for the network further enrich Purview solutions including Data Security Posture Management (DSPM) and Insider Risk Management (IRM), helping admins better understand how to reduce data exfiltration risks to locations outside of their organization.

These policies are designed to discover relevant signals from data in transit without executing any enforcement actions on that data.  \n</p><p>After integrating with one of our already-integrated Secure Access Service Edge (SASE) / Security Service Edge (SSE) partners, data security admins will be able to centrally create and manage policies for the network from the Purview portal. \n</p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b>\n</p><p> After rollout, the new policies and features will be available by default for you to enable and configure.

Thank you for your patience.&nbsp;</p><p><b>When this will happen:&nbsp;</b>Updated Rollout Schedule for iPhone and iPad</p><p>The first phase of this change is in-product notifications in the M365 Copilot app to encourage users who are editing documents to install the Word, PowerPoint, Excel apps. Users who try to browse files or manage their OneDrive libraries will be promoted to install the OneDrive app. This in-app notification will roll out to TestFlight users at the end of August and become generally available the week of September 15, 2025. This is a modification from the initial post to allow our enterprise customers more time to prepare.</p><p>The second phase of this change updates the Word, PowerPoint and Excel functionality in the Microsoft 365 Copilot app with previewers that will be made available to TestFlight users only in October and GA rollout will begin mid-October 2025. This will be a gradual, phased rollout that will take about 4 weeks or so to reach 100% of customers. These changes only apply to iPhone for now, iPad will see similar changes with a start of TestFlight in early November, and the start of the GA rollout in mid November. For iPad we will have a phased rollout that gradually ramps up to 100% of GA in about 4 weeks time.</p><p>To get early builds and test out features before GA dates – you will need to join the iOS TestFlight program for the Microsoft 365 Copilot app.  There are a limited number of seats available in the iOS TestFlight program. We periodically remove inactive users (those who have not updated their build) to make space for others. If you are unable to join because the program is full, please check back later, or contact your Microsoft Support representative.

Users will continue to be able to view files and use Copilot Chat to get deeper analysis and insights on their content. If a user needs to edit, the M365 Copilot app will transition to the standalone Word, Excel, or PowerPoint apps. Users of the M365 Copilot app will continue to be able to browse and search recent files in the app, but users seeking comprehensive file management features will be encouraged to utilize the OneDrive app. When users land in the M365 Copilot app Search experience and navigate to the My files, Libraries, or My device entry points a notification will appear promoting the use of the OneDrive app for these actions.\n</p><p>Detailed Change Log: Word, Excel, PowerPoint, M365 Copilot App \n</p><ul><li>Word, Excel, PowerPoint: The Microsoft 365 Copilot app for iPhone and iPad will a provide a Copilot powered preview experience for documents.

For advanced file management, users will be directed to the standalone OneDrive app. \n</li><li>Create Experience: Document creation in the M365 Copilot app will be available from chat. After file creation, users can view the file within M365 Copilot. Editing the document will transition to the standalone WXP apps. \n</li><li>Offline File Experience: For users who wish to make files available offline, please use the Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and OneDrive apps. \"Make Available Offline\" is being removed from the M365 Copilot app in favor of Copilot powered previewer experiences.\n</li><li>PDF Workflows: No changes.

This feature will reach general availability on October 31, 2025.<br><br><b>How does this affect me?</b><br>The Case Management Agent provides the following capabilities:<ul>\n<li><b>Automate case creation and case details during live chats and from incoming emails</b>:When a customer service representative accepts a live chat, the Case Management Agent will automatically create a case and fill in the required information. When the conversation ends, the agent automatically updates the case fields. When automatic record creation (ARC) rules convert an email into a case, the system automatically extracts the required information from the email and populates case fields. The case will stay up to date as the customer sends new emails.</li>\n<li><b>Automate case resolution</b>: Once the case is created and updated, the Case Management Agent will leverage <i>identified intent</i> to autonomously draft and send email responses after a case is created. This ensures timely communication and resolution of customer issues with minimal human intervention.</li>\n<li><b>Automate case follow-up and closure</b>: Once resolution is provided, the Case Management Agent sends follow-up emails. When a customer responds, the agent resolves the case or will alert the service representative when needed. These capabilities boost efficiency and closure to reduce case handling time.</li></ul><b>What action do I need to take?</b><br>This message is for awareness, and no action is required.<br><br>If you would like more information on this feature, please visit <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://aka.ms/12110\">Set up Case Management Agent for case creation and update (preview)</a>.",

This improvement supports better alignment with modern security practices and over time will make it easier for organizations using multiple Microsoft products to manage and maintain their firewall configurations. As a result, customers may be required to add these network (firewall) configurations in third-party applications to enable proper function of Intune device and app management.

If your outbound traffic policy doesn’t include the new Azure Front Door IP address ranges, users may face login issues, devices might lose connectivity with Intune, and access to apps like the Intune Company Portal or those protected by app protection policies could be disrupted.</p><p><b>Note:</b> The previously available PowerShell scripts for retrieving Microsoft Intune endpoint IP addresses and FQDNs no longer returns accurate data from the Office 365 Endpoint service.

The feature can leverage the mapping between your building names and your Wi-Fi networks to set the work location of your users to the right building. It can also leverage mappings to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/rooms/bookable-desks\" target=\"_blank\">specific peripherals</a>, such as monitors.

Thank you for your patience.&nbsp;</p><p>Coming soon to Microsoft Purview | Information Protection: To help improve label usability and configuration, the sensitivity labeling scheme will be simplified to only consist of labels and label groupings.</p><p>This move to a dynamic architecture will make it easier to move a child label into label groups, out of label groups, and between label groups without losing referential integrity, allowing customers to better scale and reorganize their labels across their entire data estate.\n</p><p>Tenants in scope for manual migration to the new label scheme will see a message on the <i>Sensitivity labels</i> page in the Purview portal, where the tenant admin can access a simple manual migration wizard to opt in to the migration, which should complete in less than a few minutes or even seconds, depending on the label configuration.</p><p><img src=\"https://cxcs.microsoft.net/file/ccp/en-us/490e4ae4-a990-460a-a6e2-35622780e3b1\" width=\"400\" height=\"\"></p><p>\n</p><p>If you do not see this message, your tenant does not meet the criteria for manual migration (your tenant lacks applicable parent labels). This new label scheme will be rolled out to your tenant in the coming months. (and we will send a separate MC post in advance).\n</p><p>This message is associated with Microsoft 365 Roadmap ID <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?filters=&amp;searchterms=386900\" target=\"_blank\">386900</a>.</p><p><b>When this will happen:</b></p><p>Public Preview (Worldwide): Modern labels have been in Public Preview since July 7th 2025. This post announces the rollout of modern label scheme to new tenants and tenants with applicable parents.\n</p><p>General Availability (Worldwide): We will being rolling out early December 2025 and expect to be completed by late December 2025. As part of GA, customers with non-applicable parents will be auto migrated to the modern label scheme while migration for customers with applicable parents will continue to be opt-in for 12 months post-GA. We will auto-migrate customers with applicable parents to the modern label scheme once the 12-month extension ends in December 2026.&nbsp;</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b></p><p>During migration, to ensure label scoping integrity, any applicable parent label will be converted to a child label under a new label group, and then both parent and child label will have the same display name as the original parent label. Non-applicable parent labels will automatically be converted to label groups.\n</p><p>A parent label is deemed applicable if it has a different scope from any of its children, has label actions, or is published separately from its children.\n</p><p>The manual migration wizard provides a preview of the migrated scheme so admins can better understand how their sensitivity label scheme will change after the migration.</p><p><img src=\"https://cxcs.microsoft.net/file/ccp/en-us/f27dc36f-6558-4427-9865-7e02ce1e2a4e\" width=\"400\" height=\"\"></p><p>\n</p><p>After migration, admins are free to make changes to their migrated label scheme, including unpublishing applicable parent labels that were converted to children during migration.</p><p>Users will not notice any change in how labels are viewed or applied. This change will be on by default.</p><p>Example of a migrated label scheme:\n</p><p><img src=\"https://cxcs.microsoft.net/file/ccp/en-us/89e23e5c-513d-4045-a508-d194e5e573c9\" style=\"width: 400px;\" alt=\"admin controls\">\n</p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b></p><p>This rollout will happen automatically by the specified dates with no admin action required before the rollout. Review your tenant’s label scheme to ensure it is up to date. You may want to notify your admins about this change and update any relevant documentation.\n</p><p>Optionally, before you migrate your production tenant, consider migrating a test tenant configured with a label scheme that is representative of your production tenant, to become familiar with the migration process and the modern label scheme.</p><p>Learn more: <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/purview/sensitivity-labels\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"\">Learn about sensitivity labels | Microsoft Learn</a></p>",

This message serves as a reminder as we begin a broader rollout of the feature announced in 2023.</p><p>\n</p><p><b>When this will happen:</b></p><p>Ongoing rollout.&nbsp;</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b></p><p>When rolled out, users within your organization will be able to directly initiate a Teams Premium trial. These self-service trial licenses will be a part of your Microsoft organizational tenant, and you will be able to manage these licenses like other Microsoft subscriptions. You will be able to cancel these trial licenses at any time.</p><p>You will also be able to fully control whether trials are converted to paid subscriptions. Users will not need to input payment information when signing up. If a user would like to convert to a paid license, they must work with you directly to do so as there is no auto-renew functionality for these trials. If a user isn’t upgraded to a paid subscription, all services included in their Microsoft Teams Premium will end, and the user may lose read only access to data generated by Teams Premium, stored in Microsoft Teams, OneDrive, and SharePoint.<br></p><p>Users in tenants where self-service trials are disabled may still see the “Get Premium” prompt when accessing features that require a premium license. This is expected behavior and helps signal user interest to admins. It can also help identify which users in your organization may need a Teams Premium license, allowing you to better manage and allocate your available licenses.&nbsp; To reduce confusion and prevent users from submitting license requests, admins can customize the license request flow. Instead of showing the default request form, they can configure a custom message explaining that license requests are not supported in their organization. For setup instructions, see <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/commerce/licenses/manage-license-requests?view=o365-worldwide#use-your-own-request-process\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); font-family: sans-serif; font-weight: 400;\">Use your own request process – Microsoft Learn</a>.</p><p>Microsoft Teams Premium helps make your Teams meetings more intelligent, protected, and engaging.

This new integration leverages DLM features to provide an additional control for Adaptive protection that automatically preserves items deleted by a user with an elevated risk level, so items can be restored if needed.</p><p>This message is associated with Microsoft 365 Roadmap ID <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?filters=&amp;searchterms=392839\" target=\"_blank\">392839</a>.\n</p><p><b>When this will happen:</b>\n</p><p>Public preview: We will begin rolling out in late June 2024 (previously early May) and expect to complete by late July 2024 (previously mid-July).\n</p><p>General Availability:&nbsp; We will begin rolling out late June 2026 (previously early February 2026) and expect to complete by late June 2026 (previously early February 2026).</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b>\n</p><p>After the rollout, and after you enable Adaptive protection for your tenant, the retention label and auto-apply policy for data lifecycle management will be automatically created for you. This policy will automatically include elevated risk users identified by Microsoft Purview | Insider Risk Management solution. If these users delete content from Microsoft SharePoint, Microsoft OneDrive, or Microsoft Exchange, a retention label is automatically applied to that content to retain it for 120 days. Retention labels are automatically applied to unlabeled content deleted by these users. When these users are no longer at the elevated risk level, they are automatically removed from the DLM policy, and the system will no longer keep a copy of content they delete. Any content copies previously retained when the user had an elevated risk level will be kept for the 120 days as specified by the retention label.\n</p><p>Unlike other retention labeling scenarios, users do not see the retention label, and you do not need to create or manage the retention label or policy. At this time, you can't change the retention period or assign different policies based on the different risk levels, or for different locations. The single retention label and auto-labeling policy for your tenant is not visible in the Microsoft Purview compliance portal.</p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b>\n</p><p>Learn more: <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/purview/retention#dynamically-mitigate-the-risk-of-accidental-or-malicious-deletes\" target=\"_blank\">Learn about retention policies &amp; labels to retain or delete | Microsoft Learn</a>\n</p><p>If you're using Adaptive protection and want to automatically retain content deleted by elevated risk users, follow these steps to turn on this new integration.\n</p><ol><li>Sign in to the <a href=\"https://compliance.microsoft.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Microsoft Purview compliance portal</a>.\n</li><li>Navigate to <i>Data lifecycle management &gt; Microsoft 365 &gt; Adaptive protection settings</i> in the top right corner.\n</li><li>Turn the setting ON and select <i>Save</i>.\n</li></ol><p>\n</p><p><img src=\"https://cxcs.microsoft.net/file/messagecenter/en-us/fe6a20ed-77ce-44ce-b862-bc7f4b78b93e\" style=\"width: 400px;\" alt=\"admin settings\">\n</p><p><img src=\"https://cxcs.microsoft.net/file/messagecenter/en-us/521b359c-13a9-41ef-ad96-215789a32eb3\" style=\"width: 400px;\" alt=\"admin settings\">\n</p><p>If you’re not using Adaptive protection already, turn on Adaptive protection and the new feature will be enabled along with Adaptive protection.\n</p><p>This rollout will happen automatically by the specified date with no admin action required before the rollout.

Thank you for your patience.&nbsp;</p><p>Coming soon for Microsoft Teams: App centric management for admin app installation introduces new admin settings to control who in the tenant has specific Teams apps preinstalled. Similar to app centric management for app availability, as communicated in MC688930 <i>(Updated) Teams admin center: App centric management and changes to app permission policies</i> (November 2023), admins will be able to install apps for users, groups, or everyone in the organization.</p><p>After rollout, app-centric management will let admins install apps individually. Existing Installed apps in app setup policies will remain intact; however, no new additions will be permitted, and only deletions will be allowed. Instead, you can install Teams apps for selected users, groups, or all users directly from the respective app. Other settings in app setup policies, including Pinned apps, will remain unchanged.</p><p>This message is associated with Microsoft 365 Roadmap ID <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?filters=&amp;searchterms=394274\" target=\"_blank\">394274</a>&nbsp;and <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?filters=&amp;searchterms=500637\" target=\"_blank\">500637</a>.</p><p><b>When this will happen:</b>\n</p><p>App centric management will roll out in following General Availability phases.\n</p><ul><li>Phase 1 | We will begin rolling this feature mid-October and complete rollout by end of November (previously end of October).

      "Content": "<p><b><b>Introduction</b></b></p>\n<p>Starting November 15, 2025, Outlook on the web and the new Outlook for Windows will begin rolling out an update to how inline images are represented in the HTML body of emails. This change is part of Microsoft’s ongoing security improvements and will affect how Outlook add-ins identify and process inline images using the attachment ID. Specifically, the update transitions from using tokenized image URLs to a more secure method using content IDs and request headers.</p>\n\n<p><b><b>When this will happen:</b></b></p>\n<p>This change will begin rolling out on November 15, 2025, to Production users. Rollouts to other environments will begin after Production rollouts are 100% complete.</p>\n\n<p><b><b>How this affects your organization:</b></b></p><p><b>What's changing:</b></p><p>Previously, inline images in the HTML mail body were represented with a URL containing the attachment ID as a query parameter. Developers could parse the HTML and do one of the following.</p><ul><li>Extract the ID from the URL and match it with the attachment ID they already had.\n</li><li>Use the entire URL in the src attribute to get the Base64 value of the inline image.</li></ul><p>Going forward, the URL for inline images will no longer contain the attachment ID. As a result, your current parsing logic won’t be able to correlate the inline image in the mail body with the attachment ID or Base64 value of the image.</p>\n\n\n<p><b>What will happen:</b></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Images will be represented by a content ID (cid) in the src attribute.&nbsp;</li>\n<li>Add-ins that extract the attachment ID from the image URL will no longer be able to correlate images reliably.</li>\n<li>With this change, add-ins must:\n  <ul>\n\n<li>Parse the HTML message body and retrieve the <code>cid</code> value from the <code>src</code> attribute of the <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> element.</li>\n    <li>Use <code>Office.context.mailbox.item.getAttachmentsAsync</code> to retrieve an <code>AttachmentDetailsCompose</code> object.</li><li>To restore correlation, match the <code>contentId</code> property from the object to the <code>cid</code> value in the HTML.</li><li>To retrieve base64 value of the image attachment, use <code>office.context.mailbox.item.getAttachmentContentAsync</code>.&nbsp;</li>\n  </ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><b>Example AttachmentDetailsCompose object:</b></p>\n<pre><code>[\n{\n  \"id\": \"AAkALgAAAAAAHYQDEapmEc2byACqAC/EWg0AW4xUByFbp0CroCNphMYEEAADMWhyywAAARIAEADghOrwhp8zR7umVQRBkN51\",\n  \"name\": \"image.png\",\n  \"contentType\": \"image/png\",\n  \"size\": 2371,\n  \"attachmentType\": \"file\",\n  \"isInline\": true,\n  \"contentId\": \"7957e11a-ce80-438b-87cd-611b3d6a3ec4\"\n}\n]\n</code></pre>\n<p><b><b>What you can do to prepare:</b></b></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Update your add-in’s parsing logic to retrieve the <code>cid</code> value from the <code>src</code> attribute of inline images.</li>\n<li>Use <code>getAttachmentsAsync</code> to match the content ID with the image.</li>\n<li>Ensure your add-in supports both the previous and updated implementations during the rollout.</li>\n<li>Test your add-in to confirm it correctly identifies and processes inline images using the new method.</li><li>Update internal developer documentation if it references the previous method of parsing inline image URLs.</li><li>Communicate this change to helpdesk or support teams if they assist with Outlook add-in troubleshooting.</li>\n<li>Review the sample code provided in the <a href=\"https://devblogs.microsoft.com/microsoft365dev/changes-to-inline-images-in-outlook/\" target=\"_blank\">Microsoft 365 Developer Blog: Changes to inline images in Outlook</a>.</li><li>Leave a comment on this post or in <a href=\"https://devblogs.microsoft.com/microsoft365dev/changes-to-inline-images-in-outlook/\" target=\"_blank\">Microsoft 365 Developer Blog: Changes to inline images in Outlook</a>&nbsp;if you have any questions.</li>\n<li>Watch the <a href=\"https://youtu.be/z-vYEb4N2go\" target=\"_blank\">October 2025 Office Add-ins Community Call </a>(YouTube link)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><b><b>Compliance considerations:</b></b></p><p>Placing the content ID in the src attribute matches how classic Outlook on Windows represents inline images.</p>\n<table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n<tbody><tr><th>Compliance Area</th><th>Explanation</th></tr>\n<tr><td>Does the change alter how existing customer data is processed, stored, or accessed?</td><td>Inline image retrieval now uses secure headers instead of tokenized URLs, changing how image data is accessed.</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Does the change modify how users can access, export, delete, or correct their personal data within Microsoft 365 services?</td><td>The method for accessing inline image data in emails is updated, which may affect how add-ins handle personal data.</td></tr>\n</tbody></table><p></p>",

It’s powered by Power Automate and designed to help you stay focused on what matters most.</p><p>This new version addresses previous concerns around complexity and performance, delivering a faster, more intuitive, and streamlined interface.

      "Content": "<p>Updated October 7, 2025: This release has completed as of October 3, 2025. Thank you for your patience.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p><a href=\"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-teams-blog/what-s-new-in-microsoft-teams-rooms-and-devices-at-enterprise/ba-p/3770137\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"font-family: sans-serif; font-weight: 400; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\">Earlier this year, the new Microsoft device ecosystem platform built on the Android Open-Source Project (AOSP) was announced</a> delivering state-of-the art security, reliability, and manageability with Microsoft Intune. Microsoft Teams Android devices will be migrating to this platform. The first step in the migration is a firmware update to Microsoft Teams Android devices in 2024. The firmware update will move devices from Android device administrator to Android AOSP management.</p><p><b>When this will happen:</b></p><p>A Preview program for select Microsoft Teams Android devices is targeted for Q2 of calendar year 2024. General release of the firmware update with the Android AOSP management stack will happen starting in Q4 of calendar year 2024 throughout Q1 of calendar year 2025 for all eligible Microsoft Teams Android devices. Auto updates will commence starting May 15th into Q3 calendar year 2025.</p><p>Eligible Microsoft Teams Android devices will initially receive a manual firmware update in Teams Admin Center so IT admins can manually verify the migration on their own schedule on select devices of their choosing.</p><p>Eventually, the firmware update for migration will be scheduled as an automatic firmware update in Teams Admin Center. This automatic firmware update can be deferred for up to 60 days from first availability based upon the admin configured stages in Teams Admin Center.</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b></p><p>The firmware upgrade, including the support for Intune management of Android (AOSP) devices must be accepted. It can be deferred for up to 60 days after it is first available. This can be done in the same way as other firmware upgrades in Teams Admin Center.&nbsp;</p><p>Devices will continue to remain signed in after the firmware upgrade.\n</p><p>Certain legacy devices will not receive the firmware upgrade for Android (AOSP) management in Intune. These devices will continue using Device Administrator.\n</p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b>\n</p><p>Policies will not be migrated automatically between Android device administrator and Android (AOSP) platforms. IT admins will need to create the appropriate new policies under the Intune Android (AOSP) platform to support their Microsoft Teams Android Devices. \n</p><p>This will need to be done before taking the firmware update for a successful migration. \n</p><p>More details on enabling support and creating enrollment profiles and policies for Intune AOSP can be found here: <a href=\"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/microsoftteamssupport/moving-teams-android-devices-to-aosp-device-management/4140893\" target=\"_blank\">Moving Teams Android Devices to AOSP Device Management | Microsoft Community Hub</a></p>\n\n \n<table><tbody>\n\n<tr><th>OEM</th>\n<th>Device Type</th>\n<th>Models</th>\n<th>Targeted Release</th>\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n<td>AudioCodes</td>\n<td>Phones</td>\n<td>C470HD</td>\n<td>Available</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr><td>AudioCodes&nbsp;</td><td>Phones</td>\n<td>C430HD\n<br>C435HD\n<br>C455HD<br></td>\n<td>Available</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr><td>AudioCodes&nbsp;</td>\n<td>Rooms</td>\n<td>RXV81<br>RXV200<br>RXPad<br></td>\n<td>Available</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n<td>Audiocodes</td>\n<td>Panels</td>\n<td>RX Panel</td>\n<td>Available</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n<td>Creston</td>\n<td>Panels</td>\n<td>TSS-770<br>TSS-1070<br></td>\n<td>April 2025</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n<td>Creston</td>\n<td>Rooms</td>\n<td>Crestron AIO Video Bar 70 \n<br>Crestron Touch Panel TS-1070<br></td>\n<td>March 2025</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n<td>Cisco</td>\n<td>Rooms</td>\n<td>Cisco Room Bar\n<br>Cisco Room Bar Pro \n<br>Cisco Room Kit EQ \n<br>Cisco Room Kit Pro\n<br>Cisco Desk Pro\n<br>Cisco Room Kit EQX \n<br>Cisco Board Pro G2 75\n<br>Cisco Board Pro 55\n<br>Cisco Board Pro 75\n<br>Cisco Board Pro G2 55 \n<br>Cisco Navigator<br></td>\n<td>Available</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n<td>Cisco</td>\n<td>Panels</td>\n<td>Cisco Navigator Panel</td>\n<td>Available</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n<td>DTEN</td>\n<td>Rooms</td>\n<td>DTEN D7X 75\"\n<br>DTEN D7X 55\" \n<br>DTEN Bar\n<br>DTEN Mate TC<br></td>\n<td>Available</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n<td>Jabra</td>\n<td>Rooms</td>\n<td>Jabra Panacast 50 VBS\n<br>Jabra Panacast 50 TC<br></td>\n<td>Available</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n<td>Logitech</td>\n<td>Rooms</td>\n<td>RallyBar <b>VR0019</b>\n<br>RallyBar mini <b>VR0020</b>\n<br>TAP IP <b>VR0029</b>\n<br>TAP\n<br>RoomMate <b>VR0030</b>\n<br>Logi Rallybar Huddle (VR0034]<br></td>\n<td>March 2025</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n<td>Logitech</td>\n<td>Panels</td>\n<td>Tap Scheduler  <b>VR0028</b>\n<br>DockFlex <b>VR0035</b><br></td>\n<td>March 2025</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n<td>Neat</td>\n<td>Rooms</td>\n<td>Neat Pad <b>NF19A1</b>\n<br>Neat Bar <b>NF19B1</b> \n<br>Neat Board <b>NF19C1</b>\n<br>Neat Bar Pro <b>NF21D1</b>\n<br>Neat Bar Gen2 <b>NF22E1</b>\n<br>Neat Board 50 <b>NF22H1</b>\n<br>Neat Board Pro 65  <b>NF23K1</b><br></td>\n<td>April 2025</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n<td>Neat</td>\n<td>Panels</td>\n<td>Neat Pad <b>NF19A1</b></td>\n<td>April 2025</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n<td>Neat</td>\n<td>Displays</td><td>Neat Frame <b>NF21F1</b></td>\n<td>TBD</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n<td>Poly</td>\n<td>Phones</td>\n<td>CCX350 \n<br>CCX400\n<br>CCX500\n<br>CCX505\n<br>CCX600\n<br>TrioC60<br></td>\n<td>March 25</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n<td>Poly</td>\n<td>Rooms</td>\n<td>Poly Studio X30\n<br>Poly Studio X50\n<br>Poly Studio X52\n<br>Poly Studio X70\n<br>Poly Studio X72\n<br>Poly Studio G7500\n<br>Poly Studio G62\n<br>Poly TC8\n<br>Poly TC10<br></td>\n<td>March 2025</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n<td>Poly</td>\n<td>Panels</td>\n<td>TC10 - Panel</td>\n<td>March 2025</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n<td>Yealink</td>\n<td>Phones  <b>MP5X</b></td>\n<td>MP54\n<br>MP56\n<br>MP58\n<br>CP965<br></td>\n<td>March 2025</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n<td>Yealink</td>\n<td>Phones  <b>MP5X E2</b></td>\n<td>MP52E2\n<br>MP54E2\n<br>MP56E2 \n<br>MP58E2<br></td>\n<td>March 2025</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n<td>Yealink</td>\n<td>Rooms</td>\n<td>Yealink MeetingBar A10\n<br>Yealink MeetingBar A20\n<br>Yealink MeetingBar A30\n<br>Yealink MeetingBar A40\n<br>Yealink MeetingBoard 65\"\n<br>Yealink MeetingBoard 86\"\n<br>Yealink Deskvision A24\n<br>Yealink CTP18 \n<br>Yealink CTP25<br></td>\n<td>Available</td>\n</tr>\n\n\n<tr>\n<td>Yealink</td>\n<td>Rooms</td>\n<td>Yealink MeetingBar A40</td>\n<td><br>March 2025</td>\n\n</tr><tr>\n<td>Yealink</td>\n<td>Panels</td>\n<td>Room Panel\n<br>RoomPanel Plus<br></td>\n<td><br>Available</td>\n\n</tr><tr>\n<td>Yealink</td>\n<td>Panels</td>\n<td>Room Panel E2\n<br>RoomPanel Plus E2<br></td>\n<td><br>April 2025</td>\n</tr>\n\n\n</tbody></table>",

Thank you for your patience.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>Microsoft Purview Insider Risk Management (IRM) will be adding a new role--Data Security Investigation Contributor--to the Insider Risk Management Investigators role group. This will allow members of the Insider Risk Management Investigators role group to launch   a Data Security Investigation (DSI) from an IRM case.</p><p>DSI is a new AI-powered solution that enables data security teams to identify incident-related data, conduct deep content analysis, and mitigate risk within one unified solution. DSI enables data security admins to efficiently identify incident-relevant content by searching their Microsoft 365 data estate to locate emails, Teams messages, Copilot prompts and responses, and documents. Once the investigation is scoped, DSI’s generative AI capabilities allow admins to gain deeper insights into the impacted data, revealing critical security risks and sensitive information. Investigative capabilities include the ability to categorize evidence, perform vector searches, and examine impacted data for security and sensitive data risks. DSI visualizes correlations between investigation data, users, and their activities. To mitigate identified risks, DSI facilitates secure collaboration between partner teams. Post-investigation learnings can be used to refine existing policies to strengthen an organization's security practices.  \n</p><p>The integration between IRM and DSI allows an IRM investigator to identify when a risky user needs deeper investigation to launch a pre-scoped investigation directly from the user activity pane, allowing them to view content analysis related to that user and better assess post-incident data impact.  \n</p><p>This message is associated with roadmap ID  <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?rtc=1%26filters%3D&amp;searchterms=485707\" target=\"_blank\">485707</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>\n</p><p><b>When this will happen:</b>\n</p><p>Public Preview (Worldwide): We will begin rolling out early April 2025 and expect to complete by late April 2025.</p><p>General Availability (Worldwide): We will begin rolling out in mid-October 2025 (previously mid-July) and expect to complete by mid-December 2025 (previously mid-August).</p><p> \n</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b> \n</p><p>With this update, members of the Insider Risk Management Investigators role group will be able to create Data Security Investigations from an Insider Risk Management case.

Thank you for your patience.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;We’re making some changes to DNS provisioning of A records for all new Accepted Domains provisioned after February 1st, 2025 (previously October 1st). Between early and late February 2026 (previously early October and late October), we will gradually switch provisioning of all A records for new Accepted Domains into the new subdomains under mx.microsoft.</p><p>We are doing this to reduce the friction of adopting DNSSEC in the long run. DNSSEC is a set of extensions to DNS that provides cryptographic verification of DNS records, preventing DNS spoofing and adversary-in-the-middle attacks to DNS.\n</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b>\n</p><p>After February 1st, 2025 (previously October 1st), all A records for new Accepted Domains will be provisioned into the new subdomains under mx.microsoft.February 1st, 2025 (previously October 1st) is not secured with DNSSEC at the domain level (ex. contoso.com), then DNS resolution will work as usual. If an Accepted Domain you add to the EAC after February 1st, 2025 (previously October 1st) is secured with DNSSEC, then DNSSEC will extend to the mx.microsoft DNS record automatically and you will get the benefits of DNSSEC without having to take any further action. Any issues with DNSSEC can be addressed by disabling DNSSEC for the Accepted Domain (ex. contoso.com) via your DNS provider.</p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b>\n</p><p>If you have any automation in place, for example in workflows for Domain Setup, for MX record creation that expects A records for newly provisioned Accepted Domains to be provisioned in mail.protection.outlook.com, this automation needs to be updated by February 1st, 2025 (previously October 1st) to use List serviceConfigurationRecords Graph API (<a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/graph/api/domain-list-serviceconfigurationrecords?view=graph-rest-1.0&amp;tabs=http\" target=\"_blank\">List serviceConfigurationRecords</a>). Use List serviceConfigurationRecords to retrieve the mailExchange value for your MX record. After February 1st, 2025 (previously October 1st), List serviceConfigurationRecords Graph API will be the only source of truth for your Accepted Domains’ MX record value. You will not be able to rely on the Accepted Domain’s A record being provisioned in mail.protection.outlook.com after February 1st, 2025 (previously October 1st).</p><p>If you are using automation that expects the record to end with mail.protection.outlook.com, when you add a new Accepted Domain to the Exchange Admin Center after February 1st, 2025 (previously October 1st), mail flow may not work upon initial configuration and you will have to update your MX record to match what the Exchange Admin Center says for the domain or use the mailExchange value returned by List serviceConfigurationRecords Graph API.\n</p><p>If you expect this change to cause any issues for your organization, please share that feedback. \n</p><p><br></p>",

Thank you for your patience.</p><p><b>Introduction\n</b></p><p>We’re introducing a <i>Unified Exclusion list </i>in <i>Copilot Analytics (Microsoft Viva Insights)</i>, a new feature that provides a single, consistent way to exclude specific users from all Viva Insights. With this update, administrators will have one consolidated exclusion list that applies across the Microsoft Copilot Dashboard (in Viva Insights), Manager and Team insights, Advanced Insights, and the upcoming Microsoft 365 Copilot Chat analytics (available in <i>Copilot Dashboard</i>). Admins can manage exclusions easily through one list, simplifying configuration and safeguarding sensitive user data without impacting other organizational HR data. This ensures consistent privacy controls and data reporting for both licensed and “free” (unlicensed) Copilot users in your organization.\n</p><p>Admins can use CSV upload and Azure Active Directory (Entra ID groups) to manage exclusions in the tenant.</p><p>This message is associated with Microsoft 365 Roadmap ID <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?filters=&amp;searchterms=500161\" target=\"_blank\">500161</a>.</p><p><b>When this will happen</b></p><p><b>General Availability (Worldwide): </b>We will begin rolling out this feature update globally, starting early October 2025 (previously late-September) and expect rollout to be completed by late October 2025 (previously early October).</p><p><b>How this affects your organization\n</b></p><p>All of Viva Insights experiences will now honor the excluded users (available in the Unified Exclusion list), eliminating the inconsistencies between different surfaces. For example, if an employee is on the <i>Unified Exclusion list</i>, that user’s data will be omitted from all Copilot Dashboards, manager insights, and analyst queries uniformly. This replaces the legacy approach where the Microsoft Copilot Dashboard had its own exclusion list and Advanced Insights relied on license or service plan removal.&nbsp;</p><p>The AI administrators, Viva Insights Administrators and Global Administrators will have access to configure this updated setting.\n</p><p>\n</p><p><b>Note: </b>Any users whom you previously excluded (via the old Microsoft Copilot Dashboard exclusion list) will automatically remain excluded under the new mechanism. Those users will continue to be fully excluded from all Viva Insights data, including the new M365 Copilot Chat usage analytics, without any additional action on your part. This ensures continuity of privacy controls for existing tenants.&nbsp;</p><p>Advanced insights will additionally, continue to exclude users for whom Viva insights service plan is not available.&nbsp;</p><p><b>What you can do to prepare\n</b></p><p>No immediate action is required to enable this feature.

By default, the system will carry over users from your previous Microsoft Copilot Dashboard exclusion configuration that is already available.</li><li>Review and update the exclusion list using CSV upload or Entra ID group membership.\n</li><li>Notify relevant stakeholders about the new unified exclusion mechanism.\n</li></ul><p><i>Note: The currently implemented exclusion list under <b>Setup &gt; Microsoft Viva &gt; Viva Insights</b> is accessible to only AI administrators and Global Administrators.</i></p><p>Learn more about Copilot Dashboard licensing requirements:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/viva/insights/org-team-insights/copilot-dashboard\" target=\"_blank\">Connect to the Microsoft Copilot Dashboard for Microsoft 365 customers | Viva Insights | Microsoft Viva | Microsoft Learn</a></p><p>Before the release we will update the documentation about the Unified Exclusion list: <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/viva/insights/advanced/admin/manage-settings-copilot-dashboard\" target=\"_blank\">https://learn.microsoft.com/viva/insights/advanced/admin/manage-settings-copilot-dashboard</a></p><p><b>Compliance considerations</b></p><table class=\"table table-bordered\"><tbody><tr><td>Does this change alter how admins can monitor, report on, or demonstrate compliance activities (such as Purview or admin reporting)?</td><td>Admins now have a single control point for managing exclusions, improving consistency and auditability across Viva Insights experiences.</td></tr><tr><td>Does this change include an admin control, and can it be managed through Entra ID group membership?</td><td>Admins can manage the exclusion list using CSV upload or Entra ID group membership, providing flexible control options.</td></tr></tbody></table><p></p>",

This ensures enterprise data protection for files in your organization, regardless of which account grants Copilot access. The setting for web grounding in Copilot is also based on the identity used to access the file. If you disabled web grounding in Copilot, users will not be able to use web grounding even when using Copilot access from another account.

      "Content": "<p>Updated September 18, 2025: We have updated the timing and content below with additional information. Thank you for your patience.</p>\n<p>In response to customer feedback, we are introducing enhanced flexibility, greater scalability, and streamlined compliance management for private channels in Microsoft Teams.\n</p><p>Note: It is important for compliance managers to review and take appropriate action before migration starts for these changes to private channels. \n</p><p><b>What's changing?</b></p><p>Private channels will transition use a channel mailbox instead of individual user mailboxes. \n</p><p>Organizations with compliance policies (retention, legal hold, data loss prevention, or eDiscovery) for private channels must review these policies and must apply policies to the Microsoft 365 group for the channel’s team before migration begins to ensure continuity of the policy for a private channel.  Existing policies will continue to apply to user mailboxes; post-migration, new data will be governed by policies on the group. Note that policies applied to the team’s group can apply to all channels in the team.\n</p><p>After the transition to updated private channels in your organization, private channels will be updated as follows.\n</p><ol><li>Private channels are no longer limited to 30 per team. Instead, private channels can be added up to the limit of 1000 total channels per team.\n</li><li>Private channels can now have up to 5000 members, instead of 250.\n</li><li>Meetings can now be scheduled in private channels.\n</li><li>Compliance policies for private channels are part of the team’s group policies instead of the individual user level.\n</li></ol><p>The migration of private channels to the updated capabilities will begin in early October 2025 and continue through December 2025. During this period, private channels will continue to operate normally. Admins and compliance managers should complete any required policy changes by September 20, 2025, before the migration begins. Migration can start or end at different times for each tenant during the rollout period. To track progress, a new PowerShell command will be available for tenants to check whether their migration has started or is completed. This post will be updated soon with details on the PowerShell command.\n</p><p><b>When this will happen:</b>\n</p><p>General Availability (Worldwide): We will begin rolling out early October 2025 (prevously late September) and expect to complete by mid-December 2025.\n</p><p><b>Action required by compliance managers and admins</b></p><ol><li>Purview eDiscovery and Legal Hold</li>\n<p></p><p>With this change, private channel data will move from user mailboxes to the group mailbox, aligning with how shared channels data is stored. Previously, legal holds were applied to user mailboxes since private channel data resided in each member’s mailbox. Post-migration, the latest version of private channel message data from each user’s mailbox is moved to the private channel’s group mailbox. Message edits and deleted messages will not be copied into the group mailbox.\n</p><p>Note: For users on hold, copies of message edits and deleted messages will remain in the user’s preserved library folder until the hold expires, while the latest version of private channel message data from each user’s mailbox is copied to the private channel’s group mailbox. \n</p><p>Before migration\n</p><p>If a legal hold exists for a private channel, admins must also apply the policy to the team’s group, in addition to the policy already applied to users’ mailboxes, in order for a hold to apply to new data generated and stored in the private channel’s mailbox. Note that policies applied to the team’s group can apply to all channels in the team.\n</p><p><img src=\"https://cxcs.microsoft.net/file/ccp/en-us/752d2d97-48d7-4491-a3e7-ecc866373a44  \" width=\"400\" height=\"\"></p><p>Screenshot 1: Setting up a new hold in Microsoft Purview compliance portal.\n</p><p>After migration\n</p><p>For existing holds admins will need to ensure that the hold is applied to the user mailbox as well as the new group mailbox, in order for a hold to apply to existing and new message data. Any new legal holds will need to be applied to the group.\n</p><p>For complete eDiscovery, include both the private channel’s users’ mailboxes and the team’s group mailbox to retrieve pre-migration messages, message history, and post-migration new content.\n</p><p><img src=\"https://cxcs.microsoft.net/file/ccp/en-us/0de1f667-c352-400b-8a94-57237676a30d  \" width=\"400\" height=\"\"></p><p>Screenshot 2: Configuring an eDiscovery search in Microsoft Purview compliance portal.\n</p><li>Purview Data Loss Prevention (DLP)</li> \n<p></p><p>With this change, private channel messages will be included as a part of the DLP policy scoped to the private channel’s team’s group, as opposed to the user mailbox. \n</p><p>Before migration\n</p><p>Admins must modify the “Teams chat and channel messages” policy for private channels to add the team’s group containing the private channel, in addition to the user mailbox, in order to include new private channel messages in a policy. Note that policies applied to the team’s group can apply to all channels in the team.\n</p><p>After migration\n</p><p>Ensure that “Teams chat and channel messages” policy for private channels is scoped to the team’s group containing the private channel. \n</p><p><img src=\"https://cxcs.microsoft.net/file/ccp/en-us/96d2a6b8-fdf0-402c-8475-d8631fe4ae2b \" width=\"400\" height=\"\"></p><p>Screenshot 3: Configuring a data loss prevention policy in Microsoft Purview compliance portal.\n</p><li>Purview Retention Policy</li>\n<p></p><p>After this change, creation of new private channel-specific policies will not be possible in the Purview portal. Instead, “Teams channel messages” policies applied to the team’s group will now include private channels. Existing private channel policies will remain in effect and preserve all held message data in user mailboxes. Editing of existing policies will not be supported but policies can be removed.\n</p><p>Before migration\n</p><p>Apply current private channel retention policies (previously on user mailboxes) to Teams channel messages to include the team’s group, in order to include new private channel messages in a policy. In Microsoft Purview compliance portal, go to solutions &gt; Data Lifecycle Management &gt; Retention policies. Note that policies applied to the team’s group can apply to all channels in the team. \n</p><p>After migration\n</p><p>If the parent team’s group retention policy differs from the private channel’s policy, create a new or equivalent policy to ensure consistent retention.</p><p> \n</p><p><img src=\"https://cxcs.microsoft.net/file/ccp/en-us/c565bdcb-1dbc-4f94-b060-b5bbc96d368a \" width=\"400\" height=\"\"></p><p>Screenshot 4: Configuring “Teams channel messages” for a retention policy in Microsoft Purview compliance portal.</p>\n<li>Microsoft policies for Optical Character Recognition</li>\n<br><p>Optical character recognition (OCR) is managed via Data Loss Prevention (DLP) policy. Before migration, modify the corresponding DLP policy that needs be applied for OCR to private channels and change locations to all users and groups.</p><p><img src=\"https://cxcs.microsoft.net/static/public/messagecenter/neutral/333895ed-38b5-4688-8357-a7badd5978d0/5bfd9ef4fa9f2655891b6438f46ff9a9073ed02c.png \" width=\"400\" height=\"\"></p>\n</ol><p>Frequently asked questions\n</p><ol><li>How can admins identify a user’s private channel memberships?\n<ul><li>Use Teams Admin Center under team settings, or run PowerShell: Get-TeamChannelUser to list members.\n</li></ul></li><li>When is compliance manager action required?\n<ul><li>If a policy (legal hold, eDiscovery, retention, DLP) applied to a user’s mailbox, in order to include private channel messages, differs from the team policies for the team hosting the private channel. Policies must be applied to the team’s group in order to include new private channel messages in a policy. Note that policies applied to the team’s group can apply to all channels in the team.</li><li>During eDiscovery for users on hold or during migration, search both user mailbox and group mailbox for complete data on a private channel.</li></ul></li><li>What if no action is taken?\n<ul><li>User-level policies will not apply to a private channel’s new message data. Team-level policies will apply to private channels. \n</li></ul></li><li>Why isn’t Microsoft automatically applying policies from user mailboxes to a private channel’s team?\n<ul><li>Tenant admins and compliance managers must assess and apply policies as needed. Group policies apply to all channels in the Team. Some user mailbox policies are intended for all of a user’s messages, and some are intended for private channel messages. Each organization must review and decide on policies.\n</li></ul></li><li>Is there any impact to end users?\n<ul><li>During migration, users may see duplicate search results in Teams searches—both links will navigate to the same content in Microsoft Teams.\n</li></ul></li><li>When will migration happen for my tenant and how long will it take?<ul><li>Migration can start or end at different times for each tenant during the rollout period and can take some weeks depending of the tenant. To track progress, a new PowerShell command will be available for tenants to check whether their migration has started or is completed.

Thank you for your patience.\n</p><p>We’re introducing a streamlined experience for managers in the <a href=\"https://analysis.insights.cloud.microsoft/\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); font-family: sans-serif; font-weight: 400;\">Viva Insights web app</a>, which unites new tools and insights into a single location.</p><p>The changes include default- on access to a team-scoped version of the Copilot Dashboard and additional reports, along with delegation capabilities. Analysts will also be able to publish a library of embedded reports from Advanced analysis to managers, with each manager automatically seeing data tailored to their team.\n</p><p>This new web app experience will replace all manager capabilities previously offered in the Viva Insights Teams app, including the Organizational behavior insights and Copilot chat insights. Those manager capabilities will be phased out to provide a centralized place for managers to access insights.</p><p>This message is associated with Microsoft 365 Roadmap ID <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/roadmap?id=497111\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); font-family: sans-serif; font-weight: 400;\">497111</a></p><p><b>When will this happen</b></p><p>General Availability (Worldwide): We will begin rolling out early October 2025 (previously mid-September). and expect to complete by late October 2025 (previously late September).&nbsp;</p><p><b>How will this affect your organization</b></p><p>The <a href=\"https://analysis.insights.cloud.microsoft/\" target=\"_blank\">Viva Insights web app</a>&nbsp;will now serve as the single destination for manager insights, with new capabilities. \n</p><p>Key new capabilities in the web app include:\n</p><ul><li>Copilot Dashboard, tailored to the manager’s team, with pages for Adoption, Impact, and Learning.\n</li><li>Additional Copilot analytics reports, such as the Copilot for Sales adoption report, tailored to the manager’s team. \n</li><li>Analyst-published embedded reports, enabling managers to gain access to an extensive library of reports available within Advanced analysis, automatically tailored to their teams.\n</li><li>Delegation support, allowing managers to share their view with others in their organization.\n</li></ul><p>Managers using Organization insights in the Viva Insights Teams app will soon see a banner informing them of the new location to access these capabilities. Once these capabilities launch worldwide, managers will no longer be able to access Organization insights in the Teams app.</p><p><b>What do you need to do to prepare</b></p><p>No action is required by admins. Still, you might want to:</p><p>1. Prepare for default-on enablement of manager insights</p><ul><li>If you haven’t previously enabled manager insights, managers with 10 or more team members will receive access by default to Copilot insights when team views launch in late September. Admins can customize this threshold as needed (minimum allowed is 5) in the Manager settings tab of the Viva insights web app.</li><li>If your organization has already enabled manager insights and set a minimum team size threshold, those settings will continue to apply. Managers who meet the threshold and are enabled by admins will automatically gain access to the new capabilities in the Viva Insights web app.</li><li>If you wish to turn off this capability, admins can access Manager settings after this feature releases and set the \"Grant managers scoped access to Copilot insights\" toggle to off.</li></ul><p>Note: There are no changes in the license requirements needed to access team-scoped insights in the Viva insights web app. This means that managers will continue to require a Viva Insights or a Microsoft 365 Copilot license.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;2. Manage delegation controls</p><ul><li>If delegation is already in use by managers in your organization, existing delegates will automatically gain access to these new capabilities in the web app. Admins can manage delegation at the tenant or group level through the Microsoft 365 admin center.\n</li></ul><p>3. Turn on report publishing\n</p><ul><li>Admins can enable analysts to publish a broad set of Power BI reports from Advanced analysis directly to managers, giving them access to insights similar to those that exist in the Organizational behavior reports, and more! To do this, your organization must opt into the public preview for report publishing.\n</li></ul><p>4. Inform managers where to go\n</p><ul><li>A new, more powerful experience is coming. Let your managers know that these capabilities will soon be available in the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://analysis.insights.cloud.microsoft/\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); font-family: sans-serif; font-weight: 400;\">Viva Insights web app</a>.</li></ul><p>To learn more, please see:\n</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/viva/insights/org-team-insights/copilot-dashboard\" target=\"_blank\">Connect to the Microsoft Copilot Dashboard for Microsoft 365 customers | Microsoft Learn</a></li><li><a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/viva/feature-access-management\" target=\"_blank\">Microsoft Viva Feature access management | Microsoft Learn</a></li><li><a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/viva/insights/advanced/setup-maint/manager-settings\" target=\"_blank\">Configure manager settings | Microsoft Learn</a></li></ul><p><b>Compliance considerations</b></p><ul><li>Introduces or modifies AI/ML capabilities: Yes – Copilot chat insights in the Viva Insights Teams app will no longer be available. \n</li><li>Alters how existing customer data is accessed: Yes – reports tailored to manager’s teams provide new access pathways to existing data.\n</li><li>Includes admin controls: Yes – Admins can manage manager insights, delegation, and report publishing.</li></ul><p><br></p>",

Rollout for scheduled meetings and channel Meet Now will be started in early July 2025 and expected to be completed by mid-July 2025. </p><p>General Availability (GCC High, DoD):&nbsp; We will begin rolling out early August 2025 (previously early June) and expect to complete by late October 2025 (previously mid-August).</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b>\n</p><p>The new URL syntax is: https://teams.microsoft.com/meet/&lt;meeting_id&gt;?p=&lt;HashedPasscode&gt; \n</p><p>To make meeting URL shorter, we are removing several parameters such as tenant ID, conversation ID etc. This change serves two main goals: 1) improving usability of URL during sharing and 2) making the URL more secure and less susceptible to malicious attacks. \n</p><p>Here are some details about how meeting links work and when they expire: \n</p><ol><li>In case the meeting organizer gets removed from the tenant, the links to the meetings scheduled by them automatically expire. \n</li><li>&nbsp;Every meeting link expires in 60 days after the scheduled event or in 8 hours, if it was created as Meet Now. Learn more about expiration timelines for different types of meetings. \n</li></ol><p>With the Short Meeting URL release, expiration limit will be applied to all newly created links. \n</p><p>Once the change to Short Meeting URL is released, all newly created meetings will expire as described in the documentation: 60 days after meeting ends for scheduled meetings and 8 hours after creation for Meet Now. Once this expiry period is over, in case someone clicks the link (e.g. outside of Teams app OR in the meeting details inside Teams calendar section), they will be unable to join the meeting.</p><p>Note: Old links created before short meeting URL release will continue working as it previously was (user will be able to join even after the documented expiry limits).</p><p>The reason why we are making this change is simple: security is our topmost priority. Maintaining a high security level is essential to protect sensitive data, prevent financial losses, ensure business continuity, and meet compliance and legal obligations. It is a critical aspect of modern digital life and business operations. This adjustment is designed to enhance the security of Teams meeting links, thereby better safeguarding the customer tenant. We want to be on par with modern security standards, that’s why the new behavior is a step in the right direction that we must take. It’s not possible to keep the current behavior. If you think it breaks some of your business processes, please leave comment to the MC post and describe your case there. \n</p><p>Recommendations in case the meeting link has expired:  \n</p><p>For meeting organizer: We recommend scheduling a new meeting. If the meeting organizer got removed from the tenant someone else should reschedule their meetings from scratch. \n</p><p>For participant: Please reach out to the meeting organizer and ask them to reschedule the meeting or send you an updated link.</p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b>\n</p><p>You may want to check if you have any integrations that use parameters from URL. After the rollout, the URL will only contain the meeting ID. Parameters such as tenant ID, organizer ID, conversation ID and message ID will not be in the URL. \n</p><p>You may inform meeting organizers from your tenant who use expired meeting links, or you may want to make a tenant-wide announcement about this change. \n</p><p>This rollout will happen automatically by the specified date with no admin action required. You may want to notify your users about this change and update any relevant documentation as appropriate.</p>",

Thank you for your patience.</p><p>Coming soon: A new integration between Insider Risk Management (IRM) and Data Security Investigation (DSI) in Microsoft Purview. This enhancement allows data security admins to launch a pre-scoped DSI directly from an IRM case, enabling deeper investigation into risky user behavior and better post-incident impact assessment.</p><p>DSI is a new AI-powered solution that enables data security teams to identify incident-related data, conduct deep content analysis, and mitigate risk within one unified solution. DSI enables data security admins to efficiently identify incident-relevant content by searching their Microsoft 365 data estate to locate emails, Teams messages, Copilot prompts and responses, and documents. Once the investigation is scoped, DSI’s generative AI capabilities allow admins to gain deeper insights into the impacted data, revealing critical security risks and sensitive information. Investigative capabilities include the ability to categorize evidence, perform vector searches, and examine impacted data for security and sensitive data risks. To mitigate identified risks, DSI facilitates secure collaboration between partner teams. Post-investigation learnings can be used to refine existing policies to strengthen an organization's security practices.\n</p><p>This message is associated with Microsoft 365 Roadmap ID <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?filters=&amp;searchterms=486827\" target=\"_blank\">486827</a>.</p><p><b>When this will happen:</b></p><p>Public Preview: We will begin rolling out mid-July 2025 and expect to complete by late July 2025.\n</p><p>General Availability (Worldwide): We will begin rolling out late November 2025 (previously late August) and expect to complete by late December 2025 (previously late September).\n</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b>\n</p><p>After this rollout:</p><ul><li>Members of the Insider Risk Management Investigators role group can initiate a DSI directly from an IRM case.\n</li><li>However, they must also be assigned the Data Security Investigation Investigator role to view the investigation results.\n</li><li>This streamlines the investigation process by allowing admins to:<ul><li>Go to Purview compliance portal &gt; IRM</li><li>Go to <i>Cases</i>, and open any case listed</li><li>Select <i>Case actions</i>\n</li><li>Choose <i>Investigate data security with AI </i>from the dropdown menu\n</li><li>Name the investigation and select relevant content\n</li><li>Launch the investigation with a single click</li></ul></li></ul><p>This change will be available by default.\n</p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b>\n</p><p>This rollout will happen automatically by the specified date with no admin action required before the rollout.

      "Content": "<p>As part of Microsoft’s ongoing <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/trust-center/security/secure-future-initiative\" target=\"_blank\">Secure Future Initiative (SFI)</a>, starting on or shortly after <b>December&nbsp;2, 2025</b>,&nbsp;the network service endpoints for Microsoft Intune  will also use the Azure Front Door IP addresses. This improvement supports better alignment with modern security practices and over time will make it easier for organizations using multiple Microsoft products to manage and maintain their firewall configurations. As a result, customers may be required to add these network (firewall) configurations in third-party applications to enable proper function of Intune device and app management. This change will affect customers using a firewall allowlist that allows outbound traffic based on IP addresses or Azure service tags.</p><p>Do not remove any existing network endpoints required for Microsoft Intune. Additional network endpoints are documented as part of the Azure Front Door and service tags information referenced in the files linked below:</p><ul><li>Public clouds: <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=56519\" target=\"_blank\">Download Azure IP Ranges and Service Tags – Public Cloud from Official Microsoft Download Center</a>&nbsp;</li><li>Government clouds: <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=57063\" target=\"_blank\">Download Azure IP Ranges and Service Tags – US Government Cloud from Official Microsoft Download Center</a>&nbsp;</li></ul><p>The additional ranges are those listed in the JSON files linked above and can be found by searching for “AzureFrontDoor.MicrosoftSecurity”.</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b>\n</p><p>If you have configured an outbound traffic policy for Intune IP address ranges or Azure service tags for your firewalls, routers, proxy servers, client-based firewalls, VPN or network security groups, you will need to update them to include the new Azure Front Door ranges with the “AzureFrontDoor.MicrosoftSecurity” tag.&nbsp;</p><p>Intune requires internet access for devices under Intune management, whether for mobile device management or mobile application management. If your outbound traffic policy doesn’t include the new Azure Front Door IP address ranges, users may face login issues, devices might lose connectivity with Intune, and access to apps like the Intune Company Portal or those protected by app protection policies could be disrupted.</p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b>\n</p><p>Ensure that your firewall rules are updated and added to your firewall’s allowlist with the additional IP addresses documented under Azure Front Door by <b>December 2, 2025</b>.&nbsp;</p><p>Alternatively, you may add the service tag “AzureFrontDoor.MicrosoftSecurity” to your firewall rules to allow outbound traffic on port 443 for the addresses in the tag.&nbsp;</p><p>If you are not the IT admin who can make this change, notify your networking team. If you are responsible for configuring internet traffic, refer to the following documentation for more details:</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/frontdoor/origin-security?tabs=app-service-functions&amp;pivots=front-door-classic\" target=\"_blank\">Azure Front Door</a></li><li><a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-network/service-tags-overview\" target=\"_blank\">Azure service tags</a></li><li><a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/intune/intune-service/fundamentals/intune-endpoints#intune-core-service\" target=\"_blank\">Intune network endpoints</a></li><li><a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/intune/intune-service/fundamentals/intune-us-government-endpoints\" target=\"_blank\">US government network endpoints for Intune</a></li></ul><p>If you have a helpdesk, inform them about this upcoming change.

Disablement of custom scripting</b></p><p>Custom scripting will be disabled by default (setting DenyAddAndCustomizePages to 1 or $true) for sites created with the following templates:</p><ul><li>BLANKINTERNETCONTAINER#0 = Classic Publishing Portal Site\n</li><li>CMSPUBLISHING#0 = Classic Publishing Site\n</li><li>BLANKINTERNET#0 = Classic Publishing Site Blank</li><li>CSPCONTAINER#0 = SharePoint Embedded Site</li></ul><p>NOTE:\n</p><ul><li>Existing classic publishing sites created with the templates listed above will have custom scripting disabled by default. \n</li><li>Disabling custom scripting does not affect the execution of scripts that have already been added to a site or page.</li></ul><p>Refer to <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/sharepoint/security-considerations-of-allowing-custom-script\" target=\"_blank\">this documentation</a> to learn more about the security considerations of ungoverned scripting.</p><p><b>2. Ability to set site property bag valued without requiring custom scripting enablement.</b></p><p>Users no longer need to set DenyAddAndCustomizePages to $false or 0 (i.e. enable custom scripting) in a site to manage site property bag values. We have introduced a new AllowWebPropertyBagUpdateWhenDenyAddAndCustomizePagesIsEnabled setting at the site level and at the tenant level to allow adding/managing site property bag values. Please see documentation here for <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/module/sharepoint-online/set-spotenant?view=sharepoint-ps#-allowwebpropertybagupdatewhendenyaddandcustomizepagesisenabled\" target=\"_blank\">tenant level setting</a>&nbsp;and here for <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/module/sharepoint-online/set-sposite?view=sharepoint-ps#-allowwebpropertybagupdatewhendenyaddandcustomizepagesisenabled\" target=\"_blank\">the site level setting.</a>&nbsp;</p><p><b>3. Classic publishing sites creation and feature activation changes</b></p><p>Users will no longer be able to create new classic publishing related site collections or activate publishing features in existing site collections. This applies to both UX and API interactions.</p><p>Sites collections with the following templates cannot be created:</p><ul><li>BLANKINTERNETCONTAINER#0 = Publishing Portal Site\n</li><li>CMSPUBLISHING#0 = Publishing Site\n</li><li>BLANKINTERNET#0 = Publishing Site Blank\n</li><li>ENTERWIKI#0 = Enterprise Wiki\n</li><li>SRCHCEN#0 = Enterprise Search Center\n</li><li>SPSSITES#0 = Site Directory\n</li><li>SPSNHOME#0 = News Home Site\n</li><li>PRODUCTCATALOG#0 = Product Catalog\n</li><li>SPSREPORTCENTER#0 = Report Center\n</li><li>SPSTOPIC#0 = Topic Area Template</li></ul><p style=\"\">Existing classic publishing enabled site collections are unaffected and can continue regular usage, including creation of sub sites.</p><p><b>When this will happen</b></p><p>Both changes, the extended custom scripting governance and the new classic publishing restrictions, will take effect starting <b>September 15, 2025</b>.</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization</b><br></p><ul><li>When custom scripting is disabled in classic publishing sites, users will no longer be able to use script editor web parts, create custom master pages or page layouts, and utilize several other features. More details on features affected when custom scripting is disabled can be viewed in <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepoint/allow-or-prevent-custom-script#features-affected-when-custom-script-is-blocked\" target=\"_blank\">this documentation</a>.</li></ul><p>\n</p><ul><li>With the change to stop the creation of new classic publishing site collections and publishing feature activation, SharePoint admins will no longer be able to create new classic publishing enabled site collections or enable publishing features at site collection level.</li></ul><p><b>What you need to do to prepare</b></p><p>We recommend taking the following actions to prepare for these upcoming changes.</p><p>\n</p><p>1.\tInform owners of the classic publishing sites in your organization of these upcoming changes. Promote switching to use of Modern sites. Refer to <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/sharepoint/dev/transform/modernize-guidance\" target=\"_blank\">this guide</a>.</p><p>2.\tTo temporarily opt out of the custom scripting enforcement in classic publishing sites for your tenant until <b>March 15, 2026</b>, use the following PowerShell command:\n</p><p><code>Set-SPOTenant -DelayDenyAddAndCustomizePagesEnforcementOnClassicPublishingSites $true</code></p><p>3.\tTo temporarily opt out of custom scripting enforcement for a specific site (with any template) with tenant admin approval (effective for 24 hours), use the following PowerShell command:\n</p><p><code>Set-SPOSite &lt;SiteURL&gt;&nbsp;<siteurl>-DenyAddAndCustomizePages $false</siteurl></code></p><p>4.\tIf you need to allow the creation of new classic publishing site collections or enable publishing feature activations, use the following PowerShell command set the flag to allow.</p><p><code>Set-SPOTenant -AllowClassicPublishingSiteCreation $true</code></p><p>NOTE: </p><ul><li>You need to install the latest (<a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=35588&amp;msockid=1928b372f07766b62b63a78cf1426719\" target=\"_blank\">16.0.26211.12010</a> or higher) SharePoint Online Management Shell in order to run the commands above.</li><li>The DelayDenyAddAndCustomizePagesEnforcementOnClassicPublishingSites command is scheduled to end starting on <b>March 15, 2026,</b> while all other commands are expected to remain functional beyond that date.&nbsp;</li></ul><p><b>Compliance considerations</b></p><p><b>\n</b></p><p>There is no impact or change to compliance.</p><p><b>Referenced content</b>\n</p><p><a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepoint/security-considerations-of-allowing-custom-script\" target=\"_blank\">Security considerations of allowing custom script - SharePoint in Microsoft 365 | Microsoft Learn</a></p><p><a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepoint/allow-or-prevent-custom-script\" target=\"_blank\">Allow or prevent custom script - SharePoint in Microsoft 365 | Microsoft Learn</a></p><p><a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepoint/dev/transform/modernize-guidance\" target=\"_blank\">SharePoint modernization guidance | Microsoft Learn</a></p><p><br></p><p>\n</p><p>\n</p><p>\n</p><p></p><p></p>",

This capability also helps protect files as they egress from the original document library, such as for collaboration purposes or attempted exfiltration. Files downloaded from these libraries are protected at download. Users accessing these files outside of SharePoint Online have their rights evaluated in real time against the document library.

Thank you for your patience.</p><p>As part of our ongoing efforts to enhance performance and scalability, Microsoft Defender for Office 365 investigation and hunting experiences are undergoing a data platform migration to establish a more robust, efficient, and scalable data storage system. This migration aims to improve data consistency and reliability, particularly in investigation and threat-hunting experiences.\n</p><p><b>When this will happen:</b>\n</p><p>General Availability (Worldwide, GCC, GCC High, DoD): We began rolling out this migration and Phase 1 of performance improvement early November 2024 and was completed in late June 2025.</p><p>The rollout of Phase 2 of performance improvement is targeted for end December 2025.</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b></p><p><i>Key benefits</i></p><ul><li><i>Ensures data consistency across multiple user experiences: </i>By consolidating data management under a unified platform, this migration will eliminate discrepancies between different workflows, ensuring that security analysts have access to consistent and reliable data across various investigation and hunting experiences.\n</li><li><i>Establishes data parity between Threat Explorer and Advanced Hunting: </i>By leveraging a single, unified data source, the migration will ensure that data retrieved in Threat Explorer and Advanced Hunting remains synchronized. This reduces the chances of data disparity between different tools and allows security teams to conduct investigations with better accuracy.\n</li><li><i>Enhances the data pipeline for Advanced Hunting, resulting in improved performance and accuracy</i>: The migration will optimize data ingestion pipeline and proactive monitoring system of Advanced Hunting. This will lead to improved data freshness and reduce the chances of potential data quality issues in data pipeline.\n</li><li><i>Accelerates development cycles for new features built on the new data platform: </i>The modernized data architecture will enable faster iteration and deployment of new features. By reducing dependencies on legacy systems and adopting a scalable infrastructure, Microsoft can introduce feature enhancements more rapidly, bringing greater value to security analysts.\n</li><li><i>Strengthens proactive monitoring capabilities to minimize potential impact on customer workflows:</i> The new platform will enhance real-time monitoring and alerting mechanisms, allowing for proactive detection and resolution of issues before they impact user workflows. Improved observability will ensure that any latency or disruptions are identified early, reducing downtime and improving system reliability.</li></ul><p><i>Potential impact</i></p><ul><li>No direct impact on customer data.\n</li><li>While the new platform brings significant improvements, users may experience slight delays in data availability (such as email metadata and post-delivery actions like quarantine release and manual remediation) in certain experiences, including Threat Explorer, Email Entity, and the Email Summary Panel.\n</li><li>In some cases, users may encounter intermittent failures for brief moment when loading the Email Summary Panel from experiences such as Quarantine and Submission immediately after an email is delivered. However, this will automatically resolve once the necessary data has been processed and stored.</li></ul><p><i>Resolution plan</i></p><p>While our team works on the migration, we are also actively working on optimizing the performance of the new data platform to align as closely as possible with the data freshness rate of Threat Explorer before the data platform migration. Also, efforts are underway to minimize failure rates across user experiences caused by temporary data unavailability.\n</p><p>The phase 1 performance improvement work was completed in late June 2025. After that, our teams are continuously monitoring the latencies and investing in further improvements to ensure seamless security operations experience to end users.</p><p>Phase 2 of the performance improvement plan is targeted to further improve the data freshness rate and is expected to complete by end of December 2025.</p><p>This change will be available by default.</p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b></p><p>This migration will happen automatically by the specified dates with no admin action required before the rollout.

The MERRL will go into enforcement in April 2026 for trial tenants and new tenants if the tenant is provisioned on/after April 1st, 2026. In April 2026, the Exchange Admin Center Report will be available for tenant admins to review Sender mailbox data on external recipient volume. In October 2026, the MERRL will go into enforcement for all cloud hosted mailboxes in the WWMT environment including existing tenants.</p><p style=\"margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:7.5pt;margin-left:0in\">Please refer to the ACS email documentation (Prepare an email communication resource for Azure Communication Services - An Azure Communication Services concept article | Microsoft Learn) or reach out to your Microsoft account team for further support in this journey.</p><p style=\"margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:7.5pt;margin-left:0in\"><b>Please note:</b> We have made the decision to not proceed with this change for DoD, GCC, or GCC High organizations at this time. We will communicate via Message center when we are ready to proceed. The External Recipient Rate Limit will only apply to WWMT/Production.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:7.5pt;margin-left:0in\">Please refer to the ACS email documentation (Prepare an email communication resource for Azure Communication Services - An Azure Communication Services concept article | Microsoft Learn) or reach out to your Microsoft account team for further support in this journey.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:7.5pt;margin-left:0in\"> ________________________________________\n</p><p style=\"margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:7.5pt;margin-left:0in\"><br></p><p style=\"margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:7.5pt;margin-left:0in\">Today, we are announcing that, beginning in April 2026 (previously October 2025), Exchange Online will begin enforcing an external recipient rate limit of 2000 recipients in 24 hours.</p><p>Exchange Online does not support bulk or high-volume transactional email. We have not enforced limiting of bulk email until now, but we plan on doing so with the introduction of an External Recipient Rate (ERR) limit. The ERR limit is being introduced to help reduce unfair usage and abuse of Exchange Online resources. </p><p><b>When this will happen:</b></p><p>The new ERR limit will be introduced in 2 phases:</p><p>Phase 1 - Starting April 1, 2026, (previously October 2025) the limit will apply to cloud-hosted mailboxes of trial tenants and all tenants created after this date.&nbsp;</p><p>Phase 2 – Starting October 1, 2026, (previously April 2026) we will start applying the limit to cloud-hosted mailboxes of existing tenants.&nbsp;</p><p> <b>How this will affect your organization:</b></p><p>Exchange Online enforces a Recipient Rate limit of 10000 recipients for cloud-hosted mailboxes. The 2000 ERR limit will become a sublimit within this 10000 Recipient Rate limit. There is no change to the Recipient Rate limit, and both of these will be rolling limits for 24-hour windows. You can send to up to 2,000 external recipients in a 24-hour period, and if you max out the external recipient rate limit then you will still be able to send to up to 8,000 internal recipients in that same period. If you don't send to any external recipients in a 24-hour period, you can send to up to 10,000 internal recipients.</p><p>For example:\n</p><ul><li>You use a cloud-hosted mailbox to send to 1,000 external recipients and 2,000 internal recipients at 6:00AM on Day 1, for a total of 3,000 recipients. You then send to another 1,000 external recipients at 8:00AM on Day 1. Because you sent to 2,000 external recipients, you will be blocked from sending to external recipients until 6:00AM on Day 2. During this period, you are able to send to up to 6,000 internal recipients, but for this example, let's assume that you don't.\n</li><li>At 6:00AM on Day 2, the 1,000 external recipients and 2,000 internal recipients sent at 6:00AM on Day 1 will no longer count toward the 24-hour limit calculation. Thus, from 6:00-8:00AM on Day 2, you can send to up to 9,000 total recipients (e.g., 9,000 internal or 8,000 internal plus 1,000 external).\n</li><li>If you don't send to any internal or external recipients during this period, then at 8:00AM on Day 2 you can again send to 10,000 recipients total with up to 2,000 of them being external recipients.</li></ul><p>\n</p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b><br></p><p>If you have a cloud-hosted mailbox that needs to exceed the ERR limit, you can move to <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/communication-services/concepts/email/email-overview\" target=\"_blank\">Azure Communication Services for Email</a>, which is designed specifically for high volume email sent to recipients external to your tenant.</p>",

There is a fee of $0.05/GB/month to store unlicensed accounts in the Microsoft 365 Archive, and a fee of $0.60/GB to reactivate accounts stored in the Microsoft 365 Archive. Account reactivation takes up to 24 hours and provides 30 days of access to the account, and then the account returns to an archived state.\n</p><p>If you take no action for OneDrive accounts that have been unlicensed for longer than 93 days, these accounts will remain inaccessible to end users until you set up an Azure subscription and enable unlicensed account billing in the Microsoft SharePoint admin center. This action will not affect tenants who have not changed the default tenant retention settings.\n</p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare</b>\n</p><p>To prepare for this change, admins can view a list of all the unlicensed OneDrive accounts in their tenant by going to the SharePoint admin center and navigating to <i>Reports &gt; OneDrive accounts</i> (this page will be rolled out to admins between July 26, 2024 and August 16, 2024). This page will provide the number of unlicensed accounts and why the accounts are unlicensed. You may have unlicensed accounts in your tenant for four reasons: \n</p><ol><li>Retention period – Account is no longer licensed but is still active because a retention period setting is keeping the account from being deleted.\n</li><li>Retention policy – Account is no longer licensed but is still active because a retention policy in Purview is keeping the account from being deleted. \n</li><li>Active user with no license – Account is active but is not licensed. This can happen if the license is removed but the user is not removed from Microsoft Entra ID (formerly Azure Active Directory).  \n</li><li>Duplicate accounts – Account is a duplicate because a licensed user has multiple OneDrive accounts associated with them. Duplicate accounts (also known as non-primary accounts) may arise if a user has geographic move, if a user leaves and then rejoins an organization, or from other factors. \n</li></ol><p>After you have taken inventory of your unlicensed accounts, we recommend that you take the following action before January 27, 2025. \n</p><ol><li>Delete unlicensed accounts that you no longer wish to retain. \n</li><li>Set up billing for accounts that you wish to retain.\n</li><li>You may want to notify your users about this change and update any relevant documentation.\n</li></ol><p>*<b>At this time, these changes do not apply to customers in Education tenants. An Education tenant is any tenant with more than 50% education licenses. Any tenant with fewer than 50% education licenses is considered commercial.&nbsp;</b>However, for any education tenant, unlicensed OneDrive accounts consume pooled storage and can pose security and compliance risks. IT admins can view the unlicensed accounts on the <i>OneDrive accounts</i> page to identify unlicensed accounts and take action.</p><p><i>Learn more</i>\n</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/SharePoint/unlicensed-onedrive-accounts\" target=\"_blank\">Manage unlicensed OneDrive user accounts - SharePoint in Microsoft 365 | Microsoft Learn</a>\n</li><li><a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/sharepoint/retention-and-deletion\" target=\"_blank\">OneDrive retention and deletion - SharePoint in Microsoft 365 | Microsoft Learn</a>\n</li><li><a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/admin/add-users/delete-a-user?view=o365-worldwide\" target=\"_blank\">Delete a user from your organization - Microsoft 365 admin | Microsoft Learn</a></li></ul><p></p>",

Thank you for your patience.</p><p>In 2018, <a href=\"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/exchange-team-blog/upcoming-changes-to-exchange-web-services-ews-api-for-office-365/ba-p/608055\" target=\"_blank\">we announced</a> that we were no longer making feature updates to Exchange Web Services (EWS) in Exchange Online, and we advised developers to move to Microsoft Graph. </p><p>In September 2023, we announced that on October 1, 2026, we will start blocking EWS requests to Exchange Online. \n</p><p>\n</p><p>We are now less than 18 months from October 1, 2026. We have made progress on closing several parity gaps with more changes in development to be released in the coming quarters. Please refer to <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/exchange/clients-and-mobile-in-exchange-online/deprecation-of-ews-exchange-online\" target=\"_blank\">Deprecation of Exchange Web Services in Exchange Online</a> for up-to-date guidance and roadmap information.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>If you haven't already, start the process of working with your application development organization and your application vendors to migrate active EWS applications on your tenant to the Graph API.&nbsp;</p><p>\n</p><p><b>When this will happen:</b></p><p>October 1, 2026</p><p><b>How this affects your organization:</b></p><p>While the EWS components of the service will continue to receive security updates and certain non-security updates, product design and features will remain unchanged. This change also applies to the EWS SDKs for Java and .NET, as well.\n</p><p>Despite this announcement, EWS is still available and supported for use in production environments. But we strongly suggest migrating to Microsoft Graph to access Exchange Online data and gain access to the latest features and functionality.\n</p><p>Today’s update and the retirement of EWS apply only to Microsoft 365 and Exchange Online (all environments); there are no changes to EWS in Exchange Server. Further, the changes in Exchange Online do not affect Outlook for Windows or Mac, Teams, or any other Microsoft product.</p><p>In our original blog post, we said this change would affect only third-party (non-Microsoft) applications.<b> We have expanded our effort and are now also removing EWS dependencies from Microsoft apps and services, and we’re going to complete that work well before October 2026</b>. We intend to do this as quickly as possible without affecting the quality of service or product.&nbsp;</p><p>There may be applications running on your tenant created by your organization or 3rd parties that use EWS. <b>We recommend <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/admin/activity-reports/ews-usage?view=o365-worldwide\" target=\"_blank\">reviewing your application portfolio</a> now </b>to get an understanding of which apps need to be updated by your organization and which applications require updates from vendors.</p><p>It is important to get started with this effort as soon as possible as the Graph API patterns are quite different from EWS. Equivalent Graph API operations may exhibit subtle differences that affect your use cases and application designs in unanticipated ways.</p><p>Migrating Applications to Microsoft Graph&nbsp;</p><p>We know there are several feature gaps between EWS and Microsoft Graph, and though the list below is not exhaustive, these are the gaps most frequently reported to us by developers:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Access to Archive Mailboxes – We are working on delivering access to archive mailboxes via Microsoft Graph and will provide an updated timeline in the coming months.\n</li><li>Folder Associated Information / User Configuration – We are working on these features and will provide an updated timeline in the coming months.\n</li><li>Exchange Online Management – We are investigating solutions for this and will provide an updated timeline in the coming months.</li><li>Access to Public Folders – After evaluating the usage of public folders, we have decided to restrict programmatic access to public folders to supported Outlook clients only, and for bulk import/export purposes. We will not provide APIs for programmatically creating, reading, updating and deleting public folders after October 2026 (also see <a href=\"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/exchange/security-related-updates-in-exchange-online/4303525\" target=\"_blank\">Security Related Updates in Exchange Online</a>).&nbsp;</li></ul><div><br></div><p>We know there are other gaps not listed above, and we continue to work on closing them, but it’s possible some functionality will not make it to Microsoft Graph. We encourage you to refer to <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/exchange/clients-and-mobile-in-exchange-online/deprecation-of-ews-exchange-online\" target=\"_blank\">Deprecation of Exchange Web Services in Exchange Online</a> for up-to-date guidance and roadmap information.&nbsp;</p><p><b>Next Steps\n</b></p><p>The retirement of these APIs follows our <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/lifecycle/policies/modern\" target=\"_blank\">Modern Lifecycle Policy</a>. We understand changes like this may cause some inconvenience, but we are confident it will ensure more secure, reliable, and performant experiences.\n</p><p>We will publish regular communications as we progress towards this deadline to aid affected tenants in identifying EWS usage. We encourage all customers to monitor Message Center and the Exchange Blog and <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/exchange/clients-and-mobile-in-exchange-online/deprecation-of-ews-exchange-online\" target=\"_blank\">Deprecation of Exchange Web Services in Exchange Online </a>for related content.&nbsp;</p><p>Thank you in advance for updating and opening your apps to a wider range of useful and intelligent features on Microsoft Graph. We are extremely excited about the growing opportunities that Microsoft Graph offers to developers, and we remain fully committed to our journey to empower developers to access Microsoft 365 data with the most modern features and tools.</p>",

Consequently, there will not be a dedicated page of work or school results and users’ work or school profiles will no longer appear on Bing.com.

In addition, the address bar will send users to work and school results on M365.cloud.microsoft rather than Bing.com. Users of the address bar can continue to find work-related documents, bookmarks, and people in suggested results—clicking on these suggestions takes users to work or school results on M365.cloud.microsoft. Users can also type \"work\" in the address bar, hit the tab key, then input their work- or school-related query to get results on a M365.cloud.microsoft page. Work and school search results will include documents, people, and bookmarks. Work search for documents will be available initially, with additional content types available as quickly as possible.\n</li><li>The Windows search box will no longer display organization branding nor the “Work” or “School” tab but will continue to support work and school search.

(For details on changes, please refer to the FAQ: https://aka.ms/MSBFAQ.)\n</p><p>Users who click on suggestions in the Edge for Business address bar or Windows search box may be redirected to Microsoft365.com before March 31, 2025. Also, as we begin testing the retirement experience, a small set of users may find before March 31 that Bing is intermittently unavailable as an entry point for work search. We recommend that you proactively inform your users of the change and direct them to M365.cloud.microsoft (formerly Office.com and Microsoft365.com) and SharePoint Online. Adding M365.cloud.microsoft to their favorites or to the favorites bar in Edge for Business may be a helpful alternative pathway. \n</p><p><b>What you can do to prepare:</b></p><p>Customers should prepare to stop using Microsoft Search in Bing by March 31, 2025, and transition to using Microsoft Search through M365.cloud.microsoft (formerly Office.com and Microsoft365.com) and SharePoint Online. We recommend that you inform users about the upcoming change and the alternatives available. \n</p><p>Adding your preferred entry point from this set to favorites or favorites bar in Edge may be a helpful alternative pathway. Admins can easily set favorites in Edge for their organization, please see details here. \n</p><p>Additionally, users can continue to use the Edge for Business address bar and the Windows search box, with some changes expected. Please educate users that they should now type \"work\" in the address bar, hit the tab key, then type in their work-related query to get work results on a M365.cloud.microsoft page.\n</p><p>If your organization is using the <code>AddressBarMicrosoftSearchInBingProviderEnabled</code> policy today, you should update to the <code>AddressBarWorkSearchResultsEnabled</code> policy, if the policy is still needed.   \n</p><p>The new policy, <code>AddressBarWorkSearchResultsEnabled</code>, will be available starting in early March, with Edge for Business version 134 (ahead of the Microsoft Search in Bing deprecation).

The current behavior of the EWSEnabled flag is that it can be set at both the tenant (organization) level and the user (mailbox) level. Currently, when the flag is set to true at the user level, it takes precedence over the organization-level setting. If a setting is Null, it means the setting is not enforced at that level. If Org and user-level are both Null, the default behavior is to allow. This hierarchical structure means that if the organization-level flag is set to false, but the user-level flag is set to true, EWS requests from that user are still allowed. In summary:</p><table class=\"table table-bordered\"><tbody><tr><td>Organization Level</td><td>User Level&nbsp;</td><td>EWS Requests</td></tr><tr><td>True or &lt;null&gt;</td><td>True or &lt;null&gt;</td><td>Allowed</td></tr><tr><td>True or &lt;null&gt;</td><td>False</td><td>Not Allowed</td></tr><tr><td>False</td><td>True</td><td>Allowed</td></tr><tr><td>False</td><td>False or &lt;null&gt;</td><td>Not Allowed</td></tr></tbody></table><p>This approach has led to situations where it can be challenging for administrators to ensure uniform policy enforcement across their organization, particularly in large and complex environments.</p><p>New Behavior\n</p><p>To address these issues, we are altering the behavior so that EWS will only be allowed if both the organization-level and user-level EWSEnabled flags are true. Here's a simplified view of the new logic:</p><table class=\"table table-bordered\"><tbody><tr><td>Organization Level</td><td>&nbsp;User Level</td><td>EWS Requests</td></tr><tr><td>True or &lt;null&gt;</td><td>True or &lt;null&gt;</td><td>Allowed</td></tr><tr><td>True or &lt;null&gt;</td><td>False</td><td>Not Allowed</td></tr><tr><td>False</td><td>True or &lt;null&gt;</td><td>Not Allowed</td></tr><tr><td>False</td><td>False</td><td>Not Allowed</td></tr></tbody></table><p>In short, EWS will be permitted only if both the organization and user-level allow it. This change ensures that administrators have better control over EWS access and can enforce policies more consistently across their entire organization</p><p><b>Next Steps:</b>\n</p><p>Please check the blog for additional information and ensure your per-user and tenant wide settings are correct before this change is made to your tenant. \n</p><ul><li>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aka.ms/EWSEnabledChange\" target=\"_blank\">The way to control EWS usage in Exchange Online is changing</a>&nbsp;</li></ul><p><b><br></b></p>",

While the applications may continue to function, using unsupported software could lead to potential security risks and other issues.

After this date, the app will no longer receive support, and the app will become read only.\n</p><p>To ensure the best experience moving forward, we strongly recommend switching your users to the <a href=\"https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/xpffzhvgqwwlhb?ocid=pdpshare&amp;hl=en-us&amp;gl=US\" target=\"_blank\">Microsoft OneNote for Windows</a> app as soon as possible. Our team is focusing on enhancing this app, providing a sleek and modern interface and improving security, and releasing new features like Loop components, voice dictation and transcription, ink improvements, a new meeting details experience, integration with the new Microsoft Outlook, and more to align with the evolving needs of our users.\n</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b>\n</p><p>Although OneNote for Windows 10 is supported until October 14, 2025, it is no longer receiving new feature updates, and it does not benefit from improvements to data syncing.\n</p><p>Starting in January 2025, users will start to see notifications in OneNote for Windows 10 about the end of support. These notifications will provide additional information and direct users to resources for a smooth transition.\n</p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b>\n</p><p><i>1. Migration guidance</i>:\n</p><p>We have developed a detailed <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoft-365-apps/deploy/deployment-guide-onenote\" target=\"_blank\">Deployment guide for OneNote</a> that includes best practices of migrating and a sample migration script. This sample script is designed to simplify the migration process for IT admins and to ensure that your users' unsynchronized data is backed up during migration. We believe this migration guidance will significantly help in achieving a successful migration process.\n</p><p><i>2. OneNote migration support in October 2024:</i>\n</p><p>To ensure a smooth transition, we are offering additional support from the OneNote team to help with the migration process for tenants who want to migrate early. The team is only available in the month of October 2024. After that, you will need to rely on the deployment guidance. To engage the OneNote team in October 2024, please provide feedback as usual on this post and include your email address.\n</p><p><i>3. App download restrictions for new users:</i></p><p>Starting November 1, 2024, new users will no longer be able to download OneNote for Windows 10 from the Microsoft Store. Given the app is approaching end of support and we are recommending using OneNote for Windows instead, we’re restricting new users from being able to install OneNote for Windows 10 moving forward. If you currently have the application installed, you will still be able to use it and receive updates until the end of support.\n</p><p>We are committed to supporting you through this transition and ensuring that your migration to OneNote for Windows is as seamless as possible.\n</p><p><i>Learn more\n</i></p><ul><li><a href=\"https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/XPFFZHVGQWWLHB?ocid=pdpshare\" target=\"_blank\">Download OneNote for Windows</a> from the Microsoft Store\n</li><li><a href=\"https://support.microsoft.com/office/what-is-happening-to-onenote-for-windows-10-2b453bfe-66bc-4ab2-9118-01e7eb54d2d6#:~:text=We%20recently%20announced%20the%20availability%20of%20the%20OneNote,Windows%2010%20will%20reach%20end-of-support%20in%20Oct%202025.\" target=\"_blank\">What is happening to OneNote for Windows 10 - Microsoft Support</a>\n</li><li><a href=\"https://support.microsoft.com/office/moving-to-onenote-on-windows-4ba7b498-aafc-44b1-8326-a582a6c71196\" target=\"_blank\">Moving to OneNote on Windows - Microsoft Support</a>\n</li><li><a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoft-365-apps/deploy/deployment-guide-onenote\" target=\"_blank\">Deployment guide for OneNote - Microsoft 365 Apps | Microsoft Learn</a></li></ul><p></p>",
