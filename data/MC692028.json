The functionality opens a new browser tab redirecting you to Teams web when users click on the Teams chat icon in the suite-header. With this new feature, the chat icon will open an embedded experience in Outlook Web, which will help users stay in the flow and not have to leave Outlook. Regarding New Outlook recently launched in Windows 11, we will continue our investments and you can expect some Teams integrations in the app coming next year.</p><p>Note: If no users in your organization are enabled for Microsoft Teams or for Teams features in Outlook Web, you can safely disregard this message.</p><p>[What you need to do to prepare:]</p><p>Users must have Teams licenses for work or school and have chat enabled <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/messaging-policies-in-teams\" target=\"_blank\">(Manage messaging policies in Teams - Microsoft Teams | Microsoft Learn).</a></p>",
