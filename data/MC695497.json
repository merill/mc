    "Content": "<p style=\"\">Updated February 25, 2024: We have updated the rollout timeline below. Thank you for your patience.</p><p style=\"\">We're excited to announce significant product upgrades focusing on enhanced FLW Availability Preferences.<br></p><p>Frontline workers often balance various personal commitments and specific work-time preferences. Through shifts, FLWs can establish availability preferences for calendar dates alongside recurring days. This feature streamlines shift assignments for frontline managers, who can seamlessly assign shifts by reviewing these availability preferences within the Shifts app.</p><p>This message is associated with Microsoft 365 Roadmap ID:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?filters=&amp;searchterms=156952\" target=\"_blank\">156952</a></p><p>[When this will happen:]</p>\n\n<p>Worldwide &amp; GCC: We will begin rolling out mid-January 2024 and expect to complete by mid-March 2024 (previously mid-February).</p>\n\n<p>[How this will affect your organization:]</p>\n\n<p>Frontline Workers can set availability by specific date in addition to recurring days. If specific dates coincide with recurring ones, they can override the recurring schedule. As dates expire, the system automatically removes them. Users also have the option to manually delete dates they no longer need.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://img-prod-cms-rt-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/cms/api/am/imageFileData/RW1eWaZ?ver=22f2\" style=\"width: 400px;\"><br></p>\n<p>[What you need to do to prepare:]</p>\n<p>There is nothing you need to do to prepare for these changes unless you choose to notify your frontline workers about these updates.&nbsp;</p>",
