We invite you to try this beta endpoint and provide us with feedback.\n</p><p>Some things to note about the API:\n</p><ul><li>It is Microsoft 365 Groups unified.\n</li><li>It supports app-delegated (user auth) and app-only access.\n</li><li>It is limited to networks in Native mode only – legacy and external Yammer networks will not be able to use this API for community creation.\n</li><li>Community creation for an existing Microsoft 365 group is out of scope.</li></ul>\n<p>This message is associated with Microsoft 365 Roadmap ID <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?filters=&amp;searchterms=178311\" target=\"_blank\">178311</a></p>\n<p>[When this will happen:]</p>\n\n<p>The Community creation API is now available as <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/overview?view=graph-rest-beta\" target=\"_blank\">MS Graph beta</a> endpoint.</p>\n\n<p>[How this will affect your organization:]</p>\n\n<p>This API does not affect the existing features and user flows.
