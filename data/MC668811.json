In an increased number of tenants:\n</p><ul><li>Microsoft 365 subscriptions listed below are being backfilled with a new service plan: the Loop app with workspaces.\n</li><li>Customers using the Loop app in preview who do not have a subscription in the list below will continue to be able to create and view Loop workspaces for the immediate future</li></ul><p>[When this will happen:]<br></p><p>We will begin making the Loop app with workspaces on by default for an increased number of tenants starting in late September 2023, and will continue into early 2024.</p><p>[How this will affect your organization:]<br></p><p>All users in your organization are already able to use Loop components across multiple Microsoft 365 applications like Teams and Outlook (subject to the administrator's settings described here: <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/loop/loop-components-configuration?view=o365-worldwide\" target=\"_blank\">Manage Loop components in OneDrive and SharePoint</a>).\n</p><p>Once the Loop app is made available for your organization, Microsoft 365 users in your tenant will be able to use the Loop app at <a href=\"https://loop.microsoft.com.\" target=\"_blank\">https://loop.microsoft.com.</a>&nbsp;You can control the state of the Loop app in your tenants: <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/loop/loop-workspaces-configuration\" target=\"_blank\">Manage Loop experiences</a>. Additionally, all users in your tenant will have a \"Recent components and pages\" tab on the Loop app Home screen that will let them see components from Teams, Outlook, and other apps.\n</p><p>For tenants getting access to the Loop app through this change - <i>Users with one of these four Microsoft 365 plans will have access to create and view Loop workspaces</i>:\n</p><ul><li>Microsoft 365 Business Standard\n</li><li>Microsoft 365 Business Premium\n</li><li>Microsoft 365 E3\n</li><li>Microsoft 365 E5\n</li></ul><p>If you have already enabled the Loop app, and users in your organization are already using the Loop app in Public Preview, there is no change at this point. All users in your organization who participated in our Public Preview will continue to be able to create and view Loop workspaces for the immediate future. We'll share more information about the pricing and availability of the Loop app in the coming months.\n</p><p>[What you need to do to prepare:]</p><p>Review the <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/loop/loop-compliance-summary\" target=\"_blank\">list of compliance capabilities that are NOT available</a> when the Loop app and workspaces become available by default in your organization. <i>If you require any of them, you have the option to proactively disable Loop workspaces in your organization using the <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/loop/loop-workspaces-configuration\" target=\"_blank\">admin setting</a>.</i> <i>We recommend you also verify that the Loop admin setting to is in the state you desire</i> (i.e. \"Enabled\", granting access to Loop workspaces, or \"Disabled\", blocking access).\n</p><p>This list of capabilities applies only to the Loop app, workspace, and pages/components created in the Loop app. It does not apply to Loop components created in either Teams, Outlook, Whiteboard or Word for the web.\n</p><p>We are actively working to add these compliance capabilities to the Loop app, and will have more timelines available in the coming months.\n</p>",
